# Minimal Context Sample Project

This sample shows what a small project can look like after adopting Project Tiny Context Harness. It is not a benchmark, template requirement or product-quality proof. It is a concrete shape for the recovery surface a fresh coding agent should read first.

## Scenario

Imagine a small issue-labeling service:

- It reads incoming GitHub issues.
- It proposes labels for a maintainer.
- It must not auto-apply labels without review.
- Most agent mistakes happen when a fresh chat forgets that boundary and edits the wrong workflow path.

The project does not need a full SDLC process. It needs a small durable memory surface.

## Files

After `sdlc-harness init`, the important files are:

```text
AGENTS.md
project_context/
  context.toml
  global.md
  architecture.md
  areas/main.md
  areas/main/verification.md
```

## AGENTS.md

Keep this file as a startup router, not a full manual:

```md
# Minimal Context Harness Protocol

This project uses Minimal Context Harness.

## Fact Sources

- Project context: `project_context/global.md`
- Architecture context: `project_context/architecture.md`
- Context graph: `project_context/context.toml`
- Product area context: `project_context/areas/**/*.md`

## Work Rule

Read the relevant Context before changing code. If a change creates a durable product, architecture, API, state or validation fact, update `project_context/**`.

## Verification

- `make validate-context`
- `npm test -- label-routing`
```

The real generated `AGENTS.md` contains more guardrails, but the important product shape is that it points the agent to the fact sources and validation entry points.

## project_context/global.md

Keep only durable project-level facts:

```md
# Project / Delivery Context

## Project Goal

- Suggest labels for new GitHub issues so maintainers can triage faster.

## Non-goals / Boundaries

- Do not auto-apply labels without maintainer review.
- Do not store GitHub tokens in Context files.
- Do not turn label suggestions into issue-priority decisions.

## Background

- Fresh agent chats often rediscover the review boundary and accidentally inspect deployment automation first.

## Verification Entry Points

- `npm test -- label-routing`
- `make validate-context`

## Current State

- Label suggestions are produced by the label-routing module.
- GitHub webhook parsing is a separate boundary.

## Next Safe Action

- Inspect label-routing tests before changing suggestion behavior.
```

## project_context/architecture.md

Keep architecture facts short:

```md
# Architecture Context

## System Boundary

- The service proposes labels; maintainers decide whether to apply them.
- GitHub API writes belong only to the reviewed-apply workflow.

## Component Map

- `src/webhook/**`: receives GitHub issue events.
- `src/label-routing/**`: maps issue text to suggested labels.
- `src/review-ui/**`: shows suggestions to maintainers.

## Constraints And Tradeoffs

- Label-routing must not import reviewed-apply code.
- Tests should cover no-write behavior for suggestion-only paths.

## Verification Implications

- `npm test -- label-routing`
- `npm test -- webhook`
```

## project_context/areas/main.md

Use area Context for ownership and local constraints:

```md
# Main Area Context

## Responsibility

- Own label suggestion behavior for GitHub issue triage.

## User / System Contract

- Input: GitHub issue title and body.
- Output: suggested labels with a short reason.
- The output is advisory until a maintainer approves it.

## Key Constraints

- Do not mutate GitHub issue labels in suggestion code.
- Keep label taxonomy changes explicit in tests.

## Code Entry Points

- `src/label-routing/suggest-labels.ts`
- `tests/label-routing.test.ts`
```

## project_context/areas/main/verification.md

Use verification role Context for repeatable validation paths, not one-off logs:

```md
# Main Verification Context

## Critical Paths

- Label-routing behavior: `npm test -- label-routing`
- Webhook parsing: `npm test -- webhook`
- Context recovery: `make validate-context`

## Expected Signals

- Label-routing tests should include an advisory-only case.
- `validate-context` should pass without storing test-result claims in Context.

## Known Dead Ends

- Running only the webhook tests does not cover label taxonomy changes.
```

## Fresh-Agent Prompt

Start a new coding-agent chat with:

```text
Read AGENTS.md and project_context/** first. Summarize the project goal, non-goals, architecture boundaries, validation entry points and next safe action before proposing code changes.
```

A useful answer should recover:

- The service suggests labels but does not auto-apply them.
- Label routing, webhook parsing and reviewed apply are separate boundaries.
- The focused validation path starts with `npm test -- label-routing`.
- Context files should not store tokens, logs or fake "tests passed" claims.

## What To Copy

Copy the shape, not the domain:

- Keep `AGENTS.md` short and directive.
- Put durable project intent in `global.md`.
- Put stable system boundaries in `architecture.md`.
- Put owned product/module facts in `areas/**`.
- Put repeatable validation paths in `verification` role Context.
- Leave execution evidence in tests, CI and review.

## What Not To Copy

- Do not create phase gates or task state just because the project uses agents.
- Do not paste code, logs or release reports into Context.
- Do not claim benchmark speedups from this sample.
- Do not replace tests or human review with `validate-context`.
