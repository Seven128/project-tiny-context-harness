# Long-Task Workflow Efficiency Policy

## Objective

The Long-Task Workflow exists to prevent false completion inside declared authority. Its acceptable machine result is binary in substance: either fresh evidence on the complete current final snapshot proves every declared Plan Item and AC, or the delivery remains explicitly unfinished or qualified.

Efficiency is subordinate to that objective. The preferred design is the lowest practical total workflow cost that preserves the same false-completion interception, or stronger interception at the same cost. A mechanism is retained only when it closes an independent delivery-drift path or enables a material total-cost reduction without weakening acceptance, fails closed where acceptance is involved and contributes more value than its Authoring, Runtime, State, Recovery, maintenance and test cost.

## Bounded Context Discovery

Default Context routing combines manifest candidates with one bounded text search over `project_context/**` before `Context Delta`. The Agent uses a small set of high-signal task terms such as explicit area/module names and API/schema/state/security/verification/deployment language, merges matches with graph/trigger candidates and reads only relevant files.

This reduces the direct trigger-miss path at low fixed cost. It is intentionally not a retrieval system: no whole-repository search requirement, vector/persistent index, cache, registry, search state or automatic authority inference is added. Keyword search supplements semantic judgment and final Conformance; it cannot eliminate synonym or indirect-dependency misses by itself.

## One-Time Execution-Model Choice

The first successful formal Compile creates Authority Lock and emits `execution_model_checkpoint.required: true`. Before product implementation, the Agent stops once and asks the user to `continue_current_model` or switch models and resume the active Long-Task. A task-specific model strategy already stated explicitly satisfies the checkpoint.

This pause exists because locked Source/Contract/Context/risk/acceptance plus targeted repair and Final Gate materially reduce the risk of choosing a lower-cost execution model. It is an execution-cost mechanism, not proof. Harness does not switch the model, persist acknowledgement/model-routing state or repeat the checkpoint after later revisions; those Compile results return `required: false`.

After the one-time choice, the current Goal continues through implementation, targeted repair and Final Gate. Small implementation-level plans, reordered steps and repair hypotheses are ordinary internal execution state; they do not become a second plan or authority.

## No Proactive Parallel-Subagent Scheduler

The Harness never proactively spawns, assigns, coordinates, retries or recovers parallel subagents. It creates no Worker queue, Wave, process tree, branch/worktree fan-out or persisted delegation graph.

A platform or Agent may internally delegate work using its own opaque behavior. The Harness neither depends on nor records that behavior, and it never treats delegation as evidence. All changes must converge into one unified current workspace snapshot; only Contract-declared checks on that snapshot can contribute to acceptance.

## Context Evolution During Implementation

`Context Delta` remains live after Authority Lock. When implementation or repair discovers a durable fact, the current Goal updates the owning Context instead of preserving a known stale fact until the end.

Referenced snapshots distinguish:

- **Controlling Context**: core Context, every explicit `context_ref`, verification and deployment Context, and other selected files whose meaning can change ownership, architecture, contract, risk, recovery or repeatable verification. A change requires Authority Revision and may require exact user approval.
- **Supporting Context**: graph-derived, non-explicit `implementation-index` and `archive` files. Their content may auto-revise through `ty-context long-task compile <workdir> --revise` without user approval and without invalidating otherwise fresh targeted Progress.

Full snapshot mode treats every Context file as controlling. Explicitly referencing an otherwise supporting file also makes it controlling. Final Gate always recompiles and records the complete current Context snapshot.

## Authority Projection Without Retrieval Friction

`context.toml` serves both future Context discovery and active Long-Task authority. Retrieval guidance—`triggers`, `read_when`, `read_policy`, default selection and unselected nodes—does not alter the meaning of Context already selected for one delivery, so it is excluded from that delivery's authority projection. Selected area ownership, role/dependency structure and selected Context contents remain protected and fail closed.

This removes unnecessary Authority Revision and scoped-Progress invalidation without adding a registry, index or state file. It does not reuse final acceptance: any changed Git tree still requires the current-snapshot Live Final Gate.

Preflight follows the same cost rule. Repair metadata is emitted only for duplicate/coverage pairs with a deterministic same-Claim dependency. Independent diagnostics keep their existing compact form, and no finding is hidden or treated as resolved.

## Rolling Target-Runtime Feedback

When a declared result can pass on a proxy surface while failing in its target runtime, delaying the first target execution until Final Gate creates avoidable rework. Replaying a tracked status report in Final Gate is worse: it reruns the reader, not the target, and can falsely accept a stale self-report on an otherwise current snapshot.

Use the existing Contract and Progress model plus one bounded target profile instead of adding open-ended platform flags or another state machine:

- declare the exact non-empty required product target refs, bounded runtime family and root entrypoint;
- put the live target Check in the earliest Outcome that owns the first runnable boundary;
- make its current Raw Execution exercise the target and derive structured Observations from that same session;
- declare runtime-affecting `input_paths`, Binding carriers, verification inputs and environment requirements so relevant changes stale Progress;
- targeted-verify once after the first runnable slice and again before dependent work grows after accumulated relevant changes;
- coalesce edits, choose the cheapest reliable Check and reuse identical Raw Execution where valid; and
- let the one Final Gate rerun the complete live Check set for acceptance.

Historical reports, screenshots, binaries and logs remain review material. Build, install, process start and absence of fatal logs prove only those exact Claims; broader runnable behavior needs a stable product-owned sentinel or declared interaction. Capability-specific probes are required only when their Claims are in scope.

Every vertical Outcome belongs to one Stage. Stage readiness reuses Outcome dependencies and Progress; the gate proves every required target from its root, and only a multi-Outcome Stage pays the additional cross-surface-consistency proof. A separate read-only Product Conformance Check is required only when weak observability combines with multiple Stages or multiple required product runtime families. Single-Stage/single-family work pays no extra conformance run.

This policy adds bounded authoring and selected runtime cost but no open-ended `platform_impact` taxonomy, scheduler, persistent trigger queue, per-platform Progress or mandatory rebuild per Outcome/edit. Terminal target and Stage projections are derived only at Final Gate; they are not another state machine. Its net value comes from earlier defect localization plus closing proxy, stale self-report, degraded-success, fixed-input, self-attested-boundary and cross-surface drift paths while preserving one final authority.

## Capability-Adequate Evidence

Checks declare keyed Given/When scenarios, a journey role, an execution target and all-of Evidence Capabilities per Assertion. Static `presence` proves only existence. Every behavioral capability requires exactly one typed current-execution record bound to the Assertion; missing, duplicate, unknown and undeclared records fail closed. Success and degradation use separate Checks, Result proof comes only from success, boundary effects use an observer target, and input variation requires distinct inputs, outputs and a failure case.

These fields concentrate verifier review at Authoring/Preflight instead of adding repeated runtime ceremony. V2 structured results remain readable for compatibility but cannot satisfy behavioral capabilities. Capability additions are monotonic evidence strengthening; removal or semantic weakening is protected Authority Revision.

## Test-Cost Layers

Use short feedback loops during development, then widen before release:

```text
npm run test:affected:list
npm run test:affected
npm run test:long-task:focused
npm run test:delivery-contract:focused
npm run test:long-task:trust
```

The affected selector maps known hot spots to focused regression tests, widens unmapped Long-Task runtime changes to the Trust Boundary Gate, and widens shared fixtures, package/dependency or unknown changes to complete suites. Dirty local discovery uses only current working-tree paths; clean local discovery uses `HEAD^`; explicit and CI bases are exact. It builds at most once per invocation when a build is required.

The Trust Boundary Gate is the middle-cost frozen-candidate check for independent high-impact authority, freshness, forged-evidence, Final Gate/Stop/close, Hook/profile and platform-boundary regressions. Pull requests run the complete default suite plus this gate. `main`, publish and release retain the complete package suite.

Affected, focused and Trust results are package feedback only. They do not replace the complete release suite, source parity, smoke, pack, release checks or the Long-Task Final Gate. Do not run the complete suite after each small repair: batch aggregate failures, rerun failed/affected coverage, then rerun the selected aggregate gate once on the frozen snapshot.
