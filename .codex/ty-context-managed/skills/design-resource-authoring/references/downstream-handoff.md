# Design Resource Handoff And Proposal Reconciliation

Generated resources remain ordinary external Source. Preserve enough identity and meaning for downstream work without creating a Tiny Context pack, registry or authority lifecycle.

## Candidate, selection and authority are separate

- **Candidate:** provider output proposed for review; it authorizes no fidelity.
- **Selection:** an explicit user/team choice, or explicit delegation with known criteria; it permits proposal reconciliation and selected-source preparation.
- **Authority adoption:** a downstream development workflow reconciles selected Source with product/surface Context and `DESIGN.md` and binds implementation/verification to declared conditions.

This Skill may preserve an input already classified as `exact-target`; it may not promote its own candidate to one. Unknown coverage remains unknown.

## Development-scope coverage

For every material in-scope surface/flow/region/component/control condition, record selected existing Source, newly generated Source, `not-applicable`, `excluded-by-scope`, `decision-required` or `unavailable`. Include only necessary surrounding context and explicit exclusions. One larger addressable artifact may cover several items; a static frame covers only conditions it actually shows.

Design resources may show user-visible triggers, transitions, states, feedback and product-rule presentation. Business, data, permission and algorithmic rules remain owned by product/technical Source and must not be invented by visuals.

## Final proposal reconciliation

Keep a task-local buffer during candidate iteration:

```yaml
selection_basis: explicit user/team choice | explicit delegated selection
selected_resources:
  - stable key, provider/project/run/entry, declared conditions, immutable digest/snapshot, editable upstream owner/locator/update method
accepted:
  - decision, rationale and affected proposal section/stable keys
rejected:
  - alternative and reason
unresolved:
  - genuine remaining choice
impacts:
  product_rules: []
  information_hierarchy: []
  surface_keys: []
  control_keys: []
  state_keys: []
  interaction_rules: []
  visual_constraints: []
```

This is an explanatory shape, not a schema or required file. Do not write during iteration. Once the direction is final:

1. confirm the selection basis and immutable resource identity;
2. consolidate duplicate/intermediate notes;
3. apply accepted decisions once while preserving all unaffected original requirements and source provenance;
4. exclude rejected and unresolved choices from requirements, keeping unresolved items visibly unresolved;
5. record selected resource keys, conditions, immutable locators/digests and editable upstream owner/locator/update method in the proposal where downstream consumers can recover and later change them;
6. make reruns idempotent—update the existing decision/reference instead of appending it again;
7. if the initial proposal has an authorized writable path, edit that file; otherwise return the full revised proposal in the response.

Never mutate a Source Plan, `project_context/**`, `DESIGN.md`, Delivery Contract, production code or tests. A small request may generate, select and reconcile in one turn; “once” describes final semantic writeback, not a required waiting phase.

If no selection occurs, return candidates plus a consolidated pending delta and leave the proposal unchanged.

## Intent-sized handoff

### Exploration

Return scope/intent, visible candidates, resource dispositions, obvious limitations, provider/artifact qualifiers and the sanity review performed. Do not require a pack, hash or validator for a throwaway unselected preview unless retrieval needs it.

### Implementation handoff

After final selection for implementation, add one project-native Markdown Source at an authorized repository path. It is ordinary Source, not a pack or Authority. The file contains readable `ty-source-item:start/end` facts plus exactly one:

````markdown
```yaml design-resource-handoff-v1
...
```
````

The strict block includes:

- output/development scope, necessary context and exclusions;
- stable resource, subject, surface/control/state and target keys;
- selected exact-target/constraint/supporting classification; candidates and inspiration do not enter covered implementation rows;
- provider version, project/run, capability/template, agent/model and live design-system binding;
- each repository-local immutable resource path, media type and exact SHA-256;
- editable upstream owner, locator and update/export method, or an explicit manual/external-update boundary when unavailable;
- declared platform, viewport, mode, state, content, input and full/reduced/not-applicable motion conditions;
- addressable evidence entries whose kinds distinguish frame/component variant/prototype state or transition/motion/responsive/input/accessibility/semantic/token/asset/annotation meaning;
- stable subjects grouped only when they truly share meaning;
- every declared scope surface represented by one unambiguous surface subject, with no stable key owned by two subjects;
- complete subject-by-dimension coverage for `surface_flow`, `visual_content`, `component_control`, `state_interaction`, `motion`, `adaptation_input`, `accessibility` and `assets`;
- exactly one disposition per subject/dimension pair: `covered`, `not_applicable`, `excluded_by_scope`, `decision_required` or `unavailable`;
- covered-row target/condition/evidence/Source-item refs and dimension-appropriate project verification methods; referenced design Source Items use `requirement`, `control` or `acceptance` markers;
- source-backed rationales for non-applicable/excluded rows; unresolved rows remain visible and make preflight fail;
- target-local acceptance blockers that downstream checks must bind rather than dismiss;
- selection basis, proposal reconciliation path/status and known limitations;
- outer review and separate provider/artifact/design qualifiers.

Unknown fields fail closed. A static frame may support only visible layout/visual/component facts for its shown condition; it cannot cover unseen interaction, motion, adaptation/input or accessibility. Run:

```text
ty-context design-resource preflight <handoff.md>
```

Do not call the handoff ready until it passes. Exploration, candidates and unselected previews still require no file, schema, hash sequence or validator. There is no fixed directory or one-file-per-control requirement.

## Recommended downstream routing

```text
initial proposal
  -> design-resource-authoring
  -> selected immutable resources + reconciled initial proposal
  -> validated design-resource-handoff-v1
  -> long-task-workflow (explicit long delivery)
     OR current native Goal + default Workflow Contract (non-long delivery)
```

`source-plan-authoring` is not an intermediate stage. A legacy Source Plan remains valid ordinary Source if supplied, but design-resource authoring never creates or edits one.

### Default Workflow consumption

The consuming Goal brings the revised proposal, selected resources and handoff as ordinary Source. It reruns shared preflight before UI Authority Closure, opens affected exact/constraint resources before deciding, classifies coverage, decides `Context Delta`, and makes every adopted decision-relevant target Context-reachable through existing owners. It routes every covered Source Item and verification method through the production owner and real-entry checks. A later update creates a new immutable version rather than overwriting the adopted baseline.

### Long-Task consumption

The same revised proposal, selected resources and validated handoff enter `long-task-workflow`'s Source-bound Contract Draft loop immediately. The marked handoff is `task.source_paths`; each Contract design target's frozen `source_paths` and Check `verification_inputs` equal that handoff plus its selected resource paths and conditions. Covered Source Items map through `source_claims` to Claims in the root conformance Assertion, and handoff acceptance blockers appear in the owning surface binding. Authority Lock, Authority Revision and Final Gate remain the sole lifecycle. This Skill creates no Contract Draft, Outcome, Receipt, Check result or Gate.

## Forbidden inferences

Unless independently proven downstream, never infer that a generated resource:

- is selected, authoritative or accepted;
- covers unlisted states, viewports, modes, platforms or accessibility;
- is native implementation because an HTML/image preview renders;
- is editable in Figma because a capability was listed; editability requires a verified upstream owner/locator/update route;
- changed Context, `DESIGN.md`, a Source Plan, code or Contract;
- proves production fidelity, correctness, test completion or release readiness.
