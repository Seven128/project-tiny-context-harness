# Source-Bound Draft Input Reference

Read this alongside `contract-authoring.md` when raw, mixed, attachment-heavy or incomplete inputs need Source-quality repair while the same Contract Draft is being mapped. Inputs enter the Draft immediately; this reference is neither an earlier Source-authoring phase nor a standalone Source Plan stage or second lifecycle.

## Objective and boundary

Preserve every material user, product, technical, visual and acceptance constraint from the initial/revised proposal and supplied resources. Add only traceable necessary derivations, defensible delegated choices and evidence-backed repository facts. Make the real Source understandable without the original conversation before Preflight/Compile, while allowing Draft decomposition and repository binding to proceed incrementally.

Do not create a Source Plan schema, CLI, Preflight, Compile, Receipt, cache, authority, state or internal Source-authoring stage. Contract YAML cannot become the sole owner of a choice or missing semantic. Do not let current implementation silently redefine intent. A pre-existing Source Plan is simply one possible input.

## Input inventory

1. Assign every proposal, selected design resource, screenshot, document, diagram, table and other attachment a stable input ID.
2. Inspect all material pages/frames/screens/tables/visible states; never silently sample a multi-part artifact.
3. Classify each input as user instruction, product requirement, technical constraint, existing proposal, selected target, repository/Context evidence, constraint, inspiration or background.
4. For visual resources, preserve selection basis, classification (`exact-target`, `constraint` or `inspiration`), stable resource/surface/control/state/target keys, declared platform/viewport/mode/state/content coverage, provider/project/run/entry provenance and immutable digest/snapshot. For Figma-native input, also preserve exact file/version/node/condition provenance, repository-readable frozen results and the residual `design-resource-handoff-v1`; a mutable link or metadata-only response is incomplete. Unselected candidates authorize no fidelity.
5. Record incorporated meaning and every unreadable, conflicting or intentionally unused part. Higher authority and user-stated precedence win; unresolved conflicts remain decisions.

## Preference and research gate

Before comparative research or a material product, technical, architecture or provider selection, identify decision-changing criteria such as fidelity versus cost, delivery speed, reliability/support, privacy/compliance, lock-in/control, operational burden, platform scope and extensibility.

Infer preferences only from user words, Source, Context or controlling constraints. If an unknown preference would materially change research or recommendation, ask one concise targeted clarification before proceeding. Do not impose a questionnaire, re-ask known preferences or pause for minor reversible choices with the same defensible recommendation.

Use current primary/authoritative evidence for changing external facts. Record source, scope and retrieval date. Preference clarification authorizes plan meaning, not payment, contracting, deployment/publication, destructive production mutation, permission grants, sensitive-data transmission or required legal/security/human approval; those remain typed external confirmations.

## Working strategies, not phases

Choose locally as needed while revising the same Draft; do not expose these as lifecycle stages or ask the user to choose:

- **refinement:** preserve and complete a substantially developed proposal;
- **synthesis:** build coherent Source from a goal plus mixed inputs;
- **hybrid:** use one proposal as backbone and fill gaps from other inputs.

A short request is sufficient when roles, goal and reference authority are recoverable. Reuse an authorized writable proposal as the real Source. If the delivery exists only in conversation, materialize exactly one project-native Markdown Source according to repository convention. Do not create a parallel planning artifact.

## Semantic authoring

For every material item, preserve one origin:

- `direct`: stated by user or controlling input, with all qualifiers;
- `derived`: unavoidable for completeness/falsifiability, identifies `Derived From`, states why necessary and changes no user capability, business rule or scope;
- `delegated`: a defensible choice requested by instructions to synthesize/refine/use judgment, records `Delegated By`, preference/evidence basis and exact added meaning;
- `evidence-backed`: repository/Context fact with exact source and no promotion of incidental code shape to product intent;
- `decision_required`: conflicting authority, explicitly user-reserved choice, missing material preference or no defensible recommendation.

High impact or several options is not itself a reason to pause when criteria support one recommendation. Keep real high-risk actions as external confirmations. Never introduce a requirement for the first time only inside acceptance criteria.

## Structure and stable keys

Use stable semantic lowercase-kebab keys and Markdown anchors where practical. Preserve keys when wording changes but meaning does not; never renumber for ordering or reuse a retired key for new meaning.

Define vertical Outcomes only when observable results are independently decidable and later verifiable. Do not split by response length, frontend/backend layer, module count, agent capacity or desired parallelism; do not merge distinct results merely for brevity.

Use only applicable semantic types:

- result/Outcome;
- Requirement (`REQ`);
- user-visible Control (`CTRL`);
- technical obligation (`OBL`);
- explicitly non-completing meaning (`NCOMP`);
- acceptance scenario (`AC`);
- global non-goal/constraint and forbidden shortcut;
- risk with exact Fact, Affected Outcome, Basis and Consequence;
- external confirmation (`EXT`);
- genuine decision (`DEC`);
- advisory implementation hint (`HINT`), which is not a material requirement.

## UI and control completeness

For each in-scope surface, record purpose, entry/exit/navigation, regions/overlays and included Control keys. For every material interactive control, independently preserve applicable:

`surface`, `region`, `control type`, `label/content`, `location`, `user task`, `visibility`, `availability`, `trigger`, `input`, `validation`, `default`, `interaction`, `navigation/result`, `loading`, `empty`, `success`, `failure`, `recovery`, `permission`, `feedback` and `accessibility`.

Do not invent controls for a non-interface delivery. A coarse frame or configured design system does not supply unshown states. Selected design resources and product/technical Source remain parallel: visuals cannot invent business/data/permission/algorithmic rules.

For every selected exact/constraint target, preserve the declared platform/viewport/mode/state/content conditions and identify which surface and Control keys it governs. Separately record any design-resource acceptance blocker supplied by the Source. File identity, hashes, provider/export success, registry membership and resource counts are integrity facts only; they do not state that a production owner, real-user journey or rendered interaction conforms.

## Acceptance and risk

Each AC has exactly one Given/When/Then scenario, names the REQ/CTRL/OBL/NCOMP meaning it accepts and introduces no undeclared product semantics. Keep representative/sample/framework checks distinct from full-population claims and partial delivery distinct from completion.

Use the Runtime's exact risk Fact names when marking risk. Data migration is `data_migration`; a weakly observable critical path is separate `critical_user_path` and `weak_observability` facts; preserve `multi_repository_change` in Source so Contract compilation can reject unsupported delivery honestly.

## Preflight/Compile convergence audit

Before Preflight/Compile confirm:

1. Every material original statement and qualifier is preserved.
2. Every supplied input is incorporated or has an explicit unreadable/unused/conflict disposition.
3. Distinct requirements and independently decidable Outcomes were not collapsed.
4. Every material UI surface/control/state is explicit or marked not applicable/unresolved.
5. Every REQ and material CTRL state has acceptance, external confirmation, decision or explicit exception.
6. Derived/delegated/evidence-backed items have traceable basis and no hidden product expansion.
7. Non-goals, forbidden shortcuts, risks and recovery are concrete.
8. No unsupported number, threshold, metric or external claim appears.
9. Selected design resources retain stable identity and exact declared coverage; candidates remain non-authoritative.
10. Every material UI surface/control can be mapped to a production target/owner, real-user entry journey and acceptance route, while every declared design blocker has an explicit machine or target-blocking external-confirmation disposition. Removing one from scope requires an explicit Source revision; Contract prose cannot waive it.
11. The Source is self-contained enough to own every mapped Draft semantic and names every still-required external artifact.

Complete non-rendering `ty-source-item:start/end` markers in the real Markdown Source without rewriting direct text, and finish the corresponding Contract mapping in the same loop. Neither markers nor this audit delay opening the Draft; all are fail-closed convergence requirements before Preflight/Compile.
