# CLI Distribution and Lifecycle Implementation

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_package`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: CLI package distribution, init/sync/upgrade/doctor lifecycle
- Updated by task: `DEV-001`, `DEV-002`, `DEV-003`, `DEV-005`, `DEV-006`, `DEV-008`, `DEV-009`, `DEV-020`, `DEV-021`, `DEV-022`, `DEV-023`, `DEV-040`, `DEV-041`, `DEV-043`, `DEV-054`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked RFC: `RFC_001`, `RFC_002`, `RFC_003`, `RFC_006`, `RFC_007`, `RFC_008`, `RFC_009`
- Linked commits: historical `DEV-*` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- `agent-project-sdlc` npm package exposes the `sdlc-harness` CLI binary.
- `init` / `init --adopt` create or adopt a project Harness without overwriting user-owned project code.
- Fresh `init` state routes new projects to `SPRINTING` with `active_role: "developer"` and `active_skill: "pjsdlc_dev_sprint"`.
- `sync` materializes managed Harness assets from package canonical assets into the selected `<harnessRoot>`.
- `upgrade` runs schema migrations and then syncs managed assets.
- `doctor` reports Harness config, managed file drift, override state and suggested gates.
- `validate-*` commands expose package-side validation entry points for Harness state and phase artifacts.
- 当前 authoring workspace 使用 `.codex` as `harnessFolderName`; `Other` agent selection still falls back to `.agent`.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
User runs sdlc-harness init/init --adopt
-> choose target Agent unless explicit harness folder/config exists
-> resolve <harnessRoot>
-> write config/state/docs scaffold
-> sync package canonical assets
-> doctor reports readiness
```

```txt
Existing project runs sdlc-harness upgrade
-> read current package/config/schema
-> run migrations for root names, managed layout, markers, plan/lifecycle shape
-> sync canonical assets
-> doctor reports remaining drift or blockers
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- Agent selection happens before folder selection. `Codex` is the default and writes `.codex`; `Other` asks for a custom folder and defaults to `.agent`.
- New project lifecycle scaffolding starts at `SPRINTING` and allows `REVIEWING` next, matching the generated `plan.yaml` / `plan.draft.yaml` sprint task protocol.
- Explicit CLI flags and existing JSON config have higher priority than interactive defaults.
- Managed files use package metadata blocks and merge strategies instead of blind overwrites.
- Package name and CLI name are intentionally separate: npm installs `agent-project-sdlc`, users run `sdlc-harness`.
- Migrations preserve compatibility with earlier `.harness`, `.agents` and `.agent` layouts while converging new installs on the configured `<harnessRoot>`.
- Validation commands mirror the Python Harness gates closely enough for package consumers to run health checks without depending on this authoring workspace.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Earlier plans used `.harness`, `.agents` and then `.agent` as defaults; current behavior is target-agent first, with Codex mapping to `.codex`.
- Historical task docs were written under `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/dev_*.md`; DEV-043 migrated those facts into this module-level doc and sibling module docs.

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

## 8. 变更记录（Change Log）

| 日期（Date） | Task ID | Commit | 摘要（Summary） |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-001` - `DEV-023` | Historical implementation commits | Built the npm package, CLI lifecycle, root migration and managed layout. |

| 2026-05-27 | `DEV-054` | Pending implementation commit | Changed fresh init lifecycle defaults from `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING` routing to `SPRINTING` developer routing. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Future package lifecycle changes should update this document instead of creating task-grain `dev_*.md` implementation docs.
- When CLI behavior changes, keep README user guidance, PRD acceptance criteria and package tests in sync.

# Consumer Lab Validation Implementation

## 1. Linked Facts

- Domain: `harness_package`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: installed-consumer workflow validation
- Updated by task: `DEV-051`, `DEV-052`, `TASK-057`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked test evidence: `.docs/07_test/harness_consumer_lab.md`
- External lab repository: `/Users/momoooo/Documents/sdlc-harness-consumer-lab`
- Latest scripted lab evidence commit: not recorded for the 2026-05-27 cleanup run
- Latest scripted lab evidence tag: not recorded for the 2026-05-27 cleanup run

## 2. What Was Built

`DEV-051` created a long-lived local consumer lab repository and installed the current source tarball `agent-project-sdlc@0.1.7` through npm. The lab keeps its own git history and a tiny toy JavaScript module so Harness behavior can be exercised against a real consumer workspace instead of only in source-repo unit fixtures.

`DEV-052` persisted that manual flow as `tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs`, an authoring-only full-lab runner. The script packages the current source workspace, installs the tarball into a consumer repository, exercises the documented package capability surface, writes JSON/Markdown reports, and classifies outcomes as `PASS`, `BLOCKED`, or `FAIL`.

The lab repository contains:

- Packaged Harness assets generated by `npx sdlc-harness init --harness-folder .codex`.
- A local Skill override under `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/`.
- Product, architecture, technical plan, implementation, review, test, release, and RFC documents for a toy text summary helper.
- `src/stringStats.js` and `tests/stringStats.test.mjs`.

The script interface is:

```sh
node tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs --report-only --lab-dir /Users/momoooo/Documents/sdlc-harness-consumer-lab
node tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs --report-only --commit-lab --lab-dir /Users/momoooo/Documents/sdlc-harness-consumer-lab
```

Key options:

- `--lab-dir <path>` selects the long-lived consumer lab.
- `--reset-lab` explicitly deletes and recreates the lab.
- By default, the script deletes the lab repository after reports are written.
- `--keep-lab` explicitly keeps the lab for debugging.
- `--report-only` writes reports and exits 0 even when the result is `BLOCKED`.
- `--commit-lab` explicitly creates a local lab evidence commit and tag, and requires `--keep-lab`.
- `--json-report <path>` and `--markdown-report <path>` override report destinations.

## 3. Verified Behavior

- Package smoke: `npm pack` and tarball install into the lab.
- Init/adopt/root selection: `init --harness-folder .codex`, `init --adopt`, and `package.json#sdlcHarness.harnessFolderName`.
- Lifecycle commands: `doctor`, `sync`, `upgrade`, and supported CLI validators.
- Managed assets: `AGENTS.md`, `Makefile`, `.codex/state/**`, `.codex/skills/**`, `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/**`, and `.github/workflows/harness.yml`.
- Local customization: Skill override append, unknown Skill override blocking, and local policy preservation.
- Workflow fixtures: PRD, architecture, technical plan, implementation, review, test, release, and RFC docs for the toy helper.
- Protocol checks: retained done task rejection, retained open task rejection, valid explicit `parallel_execution`, and invalid automatic parallel trigger rejection.
- Static checks: natural-language routing text, GitHub workflow asset, and release automation script presence.

## 4. Implementation Findings

The lab exposed a package boundary issue: installed consumers receive Make targets and workflow instructions that invoke `tools/*.py`, but those tools are not included in package assets or generated into the consumer repository.

This means the package currently has two validation surfaces:

- Package CLI validators, which work for `validate-harness`, `validate-current`, `validate-plan`, `validate-pm`, `validate-design`, `validate-dev`, `validate-review`, `validate-test`, `validate-release`, and `validate-rfc`.
- Generated Make targets, which advertise the full lifecycle but fail in a consumer-only repo because `tools/**` is missing.

Overview generation and Makefile gates remain blocked from package-only consumer workflows until either the tools are distributed or CLI coverage replaces those Makefile dependencies.

The scripted report also produces defect candidates and a recommended RFC title whenever `BLOCKED` items remain. This makes the expected follow-up explicit: every full-lab run that finds package behavior gaps should feed RFC recalibration before bug-fix `TASK-*` development tasks.

## 5. Verification

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | PASS |
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` | PASS |
| `node tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs --report-only --reset-lab --lab-dir /Users/momoooo/Documents/sdlc-harness-consumer-lab` | PASS for script execution; report decision BLOCKED due known Makefile/tools package gap; lab deleted after run |
| `test ! -e /Users/momoooo/Documents/sdlc-harness-consumer-lab` | PASS after default full lab run |
| Lab supported package capability subset | PASS: 37 checks |
| Lab full documented workflow | BLOCKED: 7 known package gaps, 0 unexpected failures |

## 6. Follow-up

Create an RFC for the package boundary fix before DEV implementation. The implementation should choose one coherent consumer contract:

- distribute the required `tools/**` into consumer repositories,
- rewrite generated Make targets to call the packaged CLI,
- or expand CLI commands and make the Makefile a thin `npx sdlc-harness` wrapper.

Any change to package public behavior, README capabilities, validators, Makefile assets, workflow Skills, sync/upgrade, migrations, release automation, or docs overview generation must also check whether `tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs` and `tests/sdlc-harness/**` need updates.

# Release Automation Implementation

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_package`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: npm release automation and registry smoke
- Updated by task: `DEV-033`, `DEV-035`, `DEV-042`, `DEV-043`, `DEV-047`, `DEV-048`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked RFC: none
- Linked commits: `DEV-033`, `DEV-035`, `DEV-042` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit; `338b4b5`; `DEV-048` implementation commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- `tools/release_npm.mjs` automates npm package version bump, gates, publish, registry verification, installed-consumer smoke and release-doc generation.
- `npm run release:npm` is the root script entrypoint.
- The script defaults to prepare/check mode; real publishing requires `--publish --yes`.
- Release evidence is written under `.docs/08_release/vX.Y.Z_npm_release.md`.
- `packages/sdlc-harness/README.md` is included in the package `files` list so npm displays public install, command, workflow and Skill override documentation.
- Root `README.md` is packaged as `assets/docs/README.md` so installed-package agents can inspect the full user guide from `node_modules` without changing consumer project files.
- Git commit, tag and push remain outside the release script and are handled by the SPRINTING task protocol.

## 3. 真实代码结构

| 文件（File） | 作用（Purpose） | 关键函数/对象（Key Functions/Objects） |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/release_npm.mjs` | Release automation entrypoint | version resolution, gate runner, publish, smoke, release doc writer |
| `package.json` | Root script adapter | `scripts.release:npm` |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/package.json` | Package version and publish metadata | `version`, `files`, `bin`, `prepack` |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/README.md` | npm registry README | public capability list, command examples, Skill override usage |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/docs/README.md` | Packaged root README asset | agent-readable full user guide copied from root `README.md` |
| `package-lock.json` | Workspace lock version record | `packages/sdlc-harness.version` |
| `.docs/08_release/*.md` | Release evidence and rollback plan | versioned release docs |

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
npm run release:npm -- --version patch --publish --yes
-> resolve next version from local package and npm registry
-> npm version --workspace agent-project-sdlc --no-git-tag-version
-> npm test
-> package check-source
-> npm pack --dry-run --json
-> npm publish
-> npm view latest verification
-> temporary consumer install smoke
-> write release doc
-> make docs-overview
-> make validate-harness
-> git diff --check
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- The script refuses accidental publish unless both `--publish` and `--yes` are present.
- Version selection can be explicit or semantic (`patch`, `minor`, `major`) and is checked against the npm registry.
- Registry smoke validates the published package by installing it into a temporary consumer and running package commands.
- Release docs are generated as durable evidence; they are not the implementation-doc source of truth for package mechanics.
- Commit and tag creation remain manual/task-driven so release automation cannot bypass Harness task ledger rules.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- The original package plan expected publish evidence to be created manually in the release stage. DEV-035 added a script because repeated package publishing became deterministic enough to automate.
- DEV-042 used the script flow to publish `agent-project-sdlc@0.1.5`.

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 测试（Test） | 覆盖范围（Coverage） | 最近记录结果（Result） |
|---|---|---|
| `node --check tools/release_npm.mjs` | Script syntax | PASS |
| `npm test` | Package build and tests before publish | PASS during release tasks |
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` | Asset drift before publish | PASS during release tasks |
| `npm pack --dry-run --json --workspace agent-project-sdlc` | Tarball content and metadata | PASS during release tasks |
| `npm publish --workspace agent-project-sdlc` | Registry publish | PASS for `v0.1.3` through `v0.1.7` |
| `npm view agent-project-sdlc version dist-tags.latest dist.integrity --json` | Registry verification | PASS for `v0.1.7` |
| `npm view agent-project-sdlc readme --json` | Registry README publication | PASS for `v0.1.7` |
| Temporary installed-consumer smoke | Published package install and CLI smoke | PASS during release tasks through `v0.1.7` |

## 8. 变更记录（Change Log）

| 日期（Date） | Task ID | Commit | 摘要（Summary） |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-033` | Historical implementation commit | Published `agent-project-sdlc@0.1.3` with release evidence. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-035` | Historical implementation commit | Added `tools/release_npm.mjs` release automation. |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-042` | `873966d` | Released `agent-project-sdlc@0.1.5`. |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-043` | DEV-043 implementation commit | Moved release-flow facts out of the old `npm_package` implementation-doc directory. |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-047` | `338b4b5` | Released `agent-project-sdlc@0.1.6`. |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-048` | DEV-048 implementation commit | Released `agent-project-sdlc@0.1.7` with package README registry data and public capability coverage. |
| 2026-05-27 | Direct user request | Working tree | Added root README to package assets for installed-package agent reads. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Keep the release script conservative; publishing must remain explicit.
- If release evidence format changes, update both `tools/release_npm.mjs` and `.docs/08_release/` expectations.

# Source Sync and Package Assets Implementation

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_package`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: package canonical assets, source sync, managed file materialization
- Updated by task: `DEV-001`, `DEV-004`, `DEV-006`, `DEV-012`, `DEV-013`, `DEV-021`, `DEV-022`, `DEV-023`, `DEV-027`, `DEV-037`, `DEV-038`, `DEV-039`, `DEV-043`

- Linked commits: historical `DEV-*` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- The authoring workspace is the source of truth for `AGENTS.md`, root `README.md`, workflow Skills, templates, policies, Makefile include assets and GitHub workflow assets.
- `package sync-source` copies or extracts those source files into `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/**`.
- `package check-source` verifies that package assets have not drifted from authoring sources.
- User-project `sync` materializes package assets into the configured `<harnessRoot>` and project root using managed strategies.
- Authoring-only Skills under `<harnessRoot>/skills/authoring/**` are excluded from package assets.

## 3. 真实代码结构

| 文件（File） | 作用（Purpose） | 关键函数/对象（Key Functions/Objects） |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/sdlc-harness/source-mappings.yaml` | Source-to-asset manifest | `source_mappings`, `mode`, `exclude` |

| `packages/sdlc-harness/src/lib/managed-file.ts` | Managed metadata blocks | `pjsdlc:sdlc-harness:*` markers |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/**` | Package canonical assets | generated from authoring source by `package sync-source` |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/docs/README.md` | Packaged agent-readable user guide | copied from root `README.md`, shipped in npm package but not auto-materialized into user project root |
| `.codex/skills/**` | Authoring source for workflow Skills | `pjsdlc_*`, `authoring/**` exclusion boundary |
| `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/**` | Authoring source for templates, policies and Makefile include | `templates`, `policies`, `make` |
| `.github/workflows/harness.yml` | Authoring source for package CI asset | workflow asset mapping |
| `tests/sdlc-harness/package-source.test.mjs` | Regression tests for source sync and drift checks | source mapping, excludes, check-source |

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Author edits Harness source files
-> sdlc-harness package sync-source
-> package assets are regenerated
-> sdlc-harness package check-source verifies no drift
-> npm package ships assets
-> user project runs sdlc-harness sync/upgrade
-> managed assets materialize into <harnessRoot> and root files
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- `AGENTS.md` is synced as an extracted managed block, so project-specific text outside the block remains user-owned.
- Root `README.md` is copied into `assets/docs/README.md` so installed packages expose the full user guide to agents without overwriting a consumer repository README.
- Skills are distributed under `<harnessRoot>/skills`, while policies/templates live under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed`.
- The package keeps a hard source mapping manifest, not a runtime scan of arbitrary repository paths.
- `copy-tree` supports exclude patterns so authoring-only material stays local to this repository.
- Makefile integration is an include block, allowing project-specific targets to win on name conflicts.
- The current package does not guarantee native skill hydration for every Agent. It distributes files in the chosen root and exposes Harness soft routing through `AGENTS.md`.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Legacy package layouts referenced `.harness/managed`, `.agents/skills` and `.agent/managed`; current generated assets use `<harnessRoot>/skills` and `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed`.
- DEV-043 removed the legacy implementation-doc directory as an active asset/documentation target; source sync does not treat `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/**` as a maintained path.

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 测试（Test） | 覆盖范围（Coverage） | 最近记录结果（Result） |
|---|---|---|
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source` | Regenerate package canonical assets from authoring source | PASS in source-sync and release tasks |
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` | Asset drift detection | PASS in source-sync, release and DEV-043 gates |
| `tests/sdlc-harness/package-source.test.mjs` | Mapping modes, excludes and drift errors | PASS in `npm test` |
| `make validate-harness` | Prompt language and generated overview consistency | PASS for DEV-043 |

## 8. 变更记录（Change Log）

| 日期（Date） | Task ID | Commit | 摘要（Summary） |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-001`, `DEV-004` | Historical implementation commits | Introduced source mappings and package source sync/check commands. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-006` - `DEV-023` | Historical implementation commits | Migrated roots, markers and managed layout to the current package asset shape. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-037` - `DEV-039` | Historical implementation commits | Added authoring Skill boundary and excluded authoring assets from package sync. |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-043` | DEV-043 implementation commit | Consolidated source-sync implementation facts from legacy task docs. |
| 2026-05-27 | Direct user request | Working tree | Added root README as a packaged docs asset for installed-package agent reads. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Any change to `.codex/skills/**`, `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/**`, `AGENTS.md`, root `README.md`, Makefile include or CI asset source should be followed by `package sync-source` and `package check-source`.
- If an operation becomes repetitive and deterministic, prefer extracting it into a script and documenting the script here instead of keeping it as manual release/development lore.

  - `/dev` 单任务开发闭环和 `/devloop` 连续开发循环语义。
  - `/review`、`/test`、`/release` 和 `/rfc` 也通过 `TASK-*` open task 做小步恢复和阶段 gate 管控。
  - `/plan`、`/goal` 与 Harness workflow 的配合边界说明。
  - 用户显式要求并行、多 agent 或多 worktree 时，映射到 optional `parallel_execution` 合同。
- 修改（Changed）:
  - `AGENTS.md`、`README.md`、`PROJECT_SPEC.md` 的日常控制说明。
  - `pjsdlc_manager` 的路由规则。
  - `pjsdlc_dev_sprint` 的开发入口规则。
  - PRD 和技术方案中的 Natural Language Control 契约。
- 未覆盖（Not covered）:
  - 不实现 CLI 子命令 `/prd`、`/design`、`/dev` 或 `/devloop`；它们是 Agent 对话层宏指令，不是 `sdlc-harness` binary 参数。
  - 不自动开启 Codex 原生 `/plan` 或 `/goal` 模式。

## 3. 真实代码结构

| 文件（File） | 作用（Purpose） | 关键函数/对象（Key Functions/Objects） |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent 入口协议 | 自然语言与宏指令、`/prd`、`/design`、`/dev`、`/devloop` |
| `README.md` | 用户视角日常使用说明 | 常用快捷入口表 |
| `PROJECT_SPEC.md` | 完整工作流规格 | 宏指令协议、Codex 适配方式 |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_manager/SKILL.md` | 意图路由 Skill | 自然语言到 workflow action 的映射规则 |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_dev_sprint/SKILL.md` | 开发阶段执行 Skill | `/dev` 与 `/devloop` 的执行边界 |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/**` | npm 包 canonical assets | 由 `package sync-source` 同步 |
| `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md` | 产品需求 | `PRD-NPM-026` |
| `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md` | 技术方案 | Natural Language Control |

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
User input
-> Manager reads lifecycle.yaml and plan.yaml
-> Natural language or /xxx detailed skill alias maps to workflow action
-> Stage Skill executes the action
-> Gates and docs update
-> Commit/push protocol records durable history
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- 输入校验（Input validation）: manager 在路由前必须读取 lifecycle 和 plan；如果当前阶段与用户意图冲突，先说明冲突和推荐路径。
- 入口语义（Entry semantics）: `/xxx` 宏指令是更完整、更细节的提示词别名；自然语言入口映射到同一 action，但由 Agent 结合上下文补足细节。
- 核心分支（Core branches）: `/prd` 只在需求阶段推进产品方案；`/design` 只在架构阶段推进 architecture / tech plan；`/dev` 执行一个最小 `TASK-*` development task 后停止；`/review`、`/test`、`/release` 和 `/rfc` 也各执行一个最小 `TASK-*`；`/devloop` 每完成一个 task 后重新读取当前状态，再决定是否继续。
- 异常处理（Error handling）: 需求、架构、allowed_paths、gate、commit/push 不清或失败时停止并报告 blocker。
- 边界兜底（Boundary fallback）: `/plan` 和 `/goal` 属于 Codex 客户端模式，Harness 只说明组合方式，不把它们当作可配置 state。
- 性能或并发注意事项（Performance or concurrency notes）: `/devloop` 每轮重新读取状态，避免连续执行时使用过期 plan 或远端状态。
- 并行语义（Parallel semantics）: 并行不是默认入口；只有用户显式提出并行时，Manager 才能创建 `parallel_execution.trigger: "user_requested"`，并根据 runtime 能力选择 `runtime_managed` 或 `user_orchestrated`。

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- 无 runtime 代码偏移；该变更只调整 Agent 行为契约和 package assets。

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 测试（Test） | 覆盖范围（Coverage） | 结果（Result） |
|---|---|---|
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` | package canonical assets 与 source workspace 一致 | PASS |
| `make validate-harness` | Harness scaffold、skill language、doc overview、implementation doc index | PASS |
| `python3 tools/validate_allowed_paths.py` | DEV-036 修改范围符合 allowed_paths | PASS |
| `git diff --check` | Markdown/YAML trailing whitespace 和 patch 格式 | PASS |

## 8. 变更记录（Change Log）

| 日期（Date） | Task ID | Commit | 摘要（Summary） |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-034` | `DEV-034` implementation commit | 增加自然语言/指令别名双入口和 `/dev`、`/devloop` 开发入口。 |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-043` | DEV-043 implementation commit | 将当前 workspace path 更新为 `.codex`，并纳入模块级 implementation doc 迁移。 |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-036` | `DEV-036` implementation commit | 澄清宏指令是详细提示词别名，并补齐 `/prd`、`/design` 阶段入口。 |
| 2026-05-27 | `DEV-050` | DEV-050 implementation commit | 增加显式 opt-in 的 parallel execution 意图路由和降级语义。 |
| 2026-05-27 | `TASK-057` | Working tree | 将 Review、测试、发布和 RFC 入口纳入统一 `TASK-*` 小任务路由语义。 |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- 后续新增阶段快捷入口时，应同时补自然语言表达和 `/xxx` 详细提示词别名，保持双入口映射到同一 workflow action。
- 如果未来实现真实 CLI command，需明确区分 Agent 对话宏指令和 `sdlc-harness` binary 子命令。

# Documentation Overview and Validation Implementation

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_workflow`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: docs overview generation, documentation indexing and validation
- Updated by task: `DEV-005`, `DEV-015`, `DEV-025`, `DEV-030`, `DEV-032`, `DEV-043`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked RFC: none
- Linked commits: historical `DEV-*` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- `.docs/INDEX.md` is the durable documentation routing table.
- `.docs/<stage>/overview.md` files are generated artifacts and are not hand edited.
- `make docs-overview` regenerates all stage overviews from Markdown slices.
- `make validate-doc-overviews` and `make validate-harness` check that generated overviews are current.
- `tools/validate_task_docs.py` requires every implementation doc slice to be linked from `.docs/INDEX.md`.
- Root README is a user guide; `PROJECT_SPEC.md` carries the heavier product/specification narrative.

## 3. 真实代码结构

| 文件（File） | 作用（Purpose） | 关键函数/对象（Key Functions/Objects） |
|---|---|---|
| `.docs/INDEX.md` | Global documentation router | stage map, active artifacts |
| `tools/build_doc_overviews.py` | Generated overview builder/checker | source hash, stage scan, Markdown rendering |
| `tools/validate_task_docs.py` | Implementation-doc index validator | implementation doc link check |
| `tools/validate_harness.py` | Harness scaffold validator | structure checks |
| `Makefile` | Validation command entrypoint | `docs-overview`, `validate-doc-overviews`, `validate-harness` |
| `README.md` | User-facing package guide | install/init/sync/upgrade/commands |
| `PROJECT_SPEC.md` | Maintainer-facing product/specification doc | architecture, workflow and package background |

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Markdown slice changes
-> update .docs/INDEX.md if routing changed
-> make docs-overview
-> generated overview.md files include source hash and slice content
-> make validate-doc-overviews / make validate-harness confirms freshness
```

```txt
Implementation doc slice exists
-> tools/validate_task_docs.py scans .docs/04_implementation/**/*.md
-> each slice must be linked from .docs/INDEX.md
-> missing links fail validate-dev / relevant gates
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- Overview files are deterministic and include every non-overview Markdown slice under their stage directory.
- Generated overviews are for browsing and handoff; Markdown slices and `.docs/INDEX.md` remain the source of truth.
- Implementation docs are validated as module/subsystem/core-flow slices, not task ledgers.
- DEV-043 removes the legacy `npm_package/dev_*.md` docs from the active docs graph and replaces them with module-level slices.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Early documentation used task-grain implementation docs. The current model uses module-level implementation docs and treats git history as the task action record.
- `README.md` was split from the full product specification so npm package users see a lightweight guide first.

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 测试（Test） | 覆盖范围（Coverage） | 最近记录结果（Result） |
|---|---|---|
| `make docs-overview` | Regenerate all `.docs/<stage>/overview.md` files | PASS for DEV-043 |
| `make validate-doc-overviews` | Check generated overview freshness | PASS for DEV-043 |
| `make validate-harness` | Harness scaffold, prompt language and overview checks | PASS for DEV-043 |
| `python3 tools/validate_task_docs.py` | Implementation docs are linked from `.docs/INDEX.md` | Covered by validate-dev and manual checks |

## 8. 变更记录（Change Log）

| 日期（Date） | Task ID | Commit | 摘要（Summary） |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-015` | Historical implementation commit | Added deterministic Markdown overview generation. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-025` | Historical implementation commit | Tightened implementation doc indexing in validation. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-030` | Historical implementation commit | Split lightweight README from full product/specification content. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-032` | Historical implementation commit | Defined implementation docs as module/subsystem/core-flow facts. |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-043` | DEV-043 implementation commit | Removed task-grain implementation docs from the active implementation-doc graph. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Never edit `overview.md` directly; regenerate it.
- When a doc slice is moved or renamed, update `.docs/INDEX.md` in the same task.

## 2. 当前实现范围

- 新增（Added）:
  - implementation doc 默认按模块、子系统或核心数据流切片的协议。
  - implementation doc template 中的 provenance 和 Change Log 字段。
  - 技术方案中的 implementation doc model 说明。
- 修改（Changed）:
  - `pjsdlc_implementation_doc` 不再默认按 task 生成 `dev_*.md`。
  - `pjsdlc_dev_sprint` 将 development task 定义为执行和提交边界，将 implementation doc 定义为长期事实边界。
  - `pjsdlc_architect_design` 和 plan/tech templates 引导 future development task 指向模块级 implementation doc；非开发 task 使用 `result_docs` 指向对应阶段产物。
  - AGENTS、PROJECT_SPEC、PRD 和 tech plan 使用同一套语义。
  - DEV-043 将历史 `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/dev_*.md` task log 合并为模块、子系统和核心数据流级 implementation docs，并从活跃实现文档图中移除 legacy 目录。

-> SPRINTING executes task as bounded work unit
-> gates pass
-> implementation_doc updates module/subsystem/core-flow fact slice
-> task id + commit recorded as provenance
-> task removed from plan.yaml
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- 输入校验（Input validation）: development open task 使用 `implementation_doc` 指向长期实现事实文档，而不是默认 `dev_*.md` task ledger；文档、Review、测试、发布和 RFC task 使用 `result_docs`。
- 核心分支（Core branches）: 修改已有模块时更新已有 implementation doc；新增稳定模块或核心数据流时创建新文档；一个 task 可更新多份相关文档。
- 异常处理（Error handling）: 若真实代码边界与 architecture / tech plan 不一致，implementation doc 必须记录 deviation，并更新 `.docs/INDEX.md`。
- 边界兜底（Boundary fallback）: 只有当 task 本身就是稳定模块/数据流边界时，implementation doc 才可以与单个 task 一一对应。
- 性能或并发注意事项（Performance or concurrency notes）: 不适用；该改动只调整 workflow 文档模型和分发资产。

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- 早期技术方案和历史 task breakdown 中的 implementation doc 路径以 `dev_*.md` 为主；DEV-032 将其定义为 legacy task log，不再作为未来默认。
- DEV-043 完成历史合并迁移，删除活跃 `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/` task-log 目录，并将事实合并到模块级 implementation docs。

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-043` | DEV-043 implementation commit | 将 legacy `npm_package/dev_*.md` task log 合并进模块级 implementation docs，并更新索引和引用。 |
| 2026-05-27 | `TASK-057` | Working tree | 明确只有 development task 使用 `implementation_doc`，其它阶段 task 使用 `result_docs`。 |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- 后续新 task 应优先更新相关模块级 implementation doc；不要默认新增 `dev_*.md`。
- 不要在 `.docs/04_implementation/` 下重新建立 task-grain ledger；task 历史动作记录以 git commit/tag/release evidence 为准。

# Skills, Prompt Routing and Authoring Implementation

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_workflow`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: workflow Skills, prompt routing, hard/soft indexing and authoring overlay
- Updated by task: `DEV-014`, `DEV-016`, `DEV-017`, `DEV-021`, `DEV-023`, `DEV-029`, `DEV-036`, `DEV-037`, `DEV-038`, `DEV-039`, `DEV-040`, `DEV-043`, `DEV-044`, `DEV-046`, `DEV-049`, `DEV-050`, `DEV-055`, `DEV-056`, `TASK-057`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`, `PROJECT_SPEC.md`

- Linked commits: historical `DEV-*` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit; `DEV-049` implementation commit; `DEV-050` implementation commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- Workflow roles are represented as local Skills under `<harnessRoot>/skills/pjsdlc_*/SKILL.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` provides the deterministic soft index from lifecycle state to `active_skill`.
- Native Agent skill hydration, when supported by the client, is a separate hard-index mechanism based on the client-specific skill root.
- Natural language intent and `/xxx` macro aliases map to the same workflow actions.
- Project-local role prompt additions live under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/<skill_name>.md` and are appended to managed Skill output by `sdlc-harness sync`.
- Override files support plain snippets and complete `SKILL.md` extensions with `name`/`description` frontmatter; complete extensions merge their `description` into final Skill metadata and append their body after stripping override frontmatter.
- The generated `Local Override` block tells maintainers and downstream agents to check the merged Skill for semantic conflicts between package base rules and project-local override rules.
- This authoring repository keeps a private authoring Skill under `.codex/skills/authoring/**`; package source sync excludes it from user projects.
- The authoring Skill requires README/package README coverage to stay aligned with all public package capabilities.
- PM, Manager, Dev and Tester prompts now describe optional parallel execution semantics and keep final fact-source integration with the main agent.
- PM and Architect prompts require deleting the superseded monolithic PRD/product or tech plan file after user-requested slicing creates replacement slices and updates the related fact-source references.
- PM, Architect, Reviewer, Tester, Release and RFC prompts now require each main workflow action to run as one small `TASK-*` `plan.yaml` task with `phase` metadata. This covers conversational generation, existing-document slicing, synthesis from prior fact sources, review batches, test evidence, release preparation and RFC recalibration.

## 3. 真实代码结构

| 文件（File） | 作用（Purpose） | 关键函数/对象（Key Functions/Objects） |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Deterministic workflow router | lifecycle-first rule, natural-language and macro mapping |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_manager/SKILL.md` | Manager prompt | status/next/advance/dev/test/review routing |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_pm_prd/SKILL.md` | Product prompt | PRD slicing and requirement gathering |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_architect_design/SKILL.md` | Architecture prompt | architecture/tech plan and `plan.draft.yaml` |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_dev_sprint/SKILL.md` | Development prompt | `/dev`, `/devloop`, one-task execution protocol |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_implementation_doc/SKILL.md` | Implementation fact prompt | module-level implementation docs |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_reviewer/SKILL.md` | Review prompt | read-only review workflow |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_tester/SKILL.md` | Testing prompt | regression/test plan workflow |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_release_manager/SKILL.md` | Release prompt | release notes, smoke and rollback plan |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_rfc_recalibrate/SKILL.md` | RFC prompt | change impact analysis |
| `.codex/skills/authoring/harness_package_design/SKILL.md` | Authoring-only prompt | package iteration, scriptability heuristic, README capability coverage |
| `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/policies/phase_contracts.yaml` | Phase-to-skill contract | `skill` per phase |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/src/lib/sync-engine.ts` | Skill materialization | base Skill copy plus local override append |
| `tools/validate_prompt_language.py` | Prompt contract validator | Chinese explanation + English identifiers |

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Agent starts work
-> read .codex/state/lifecycle.yaml
-> read active_skill unless user requested another workflow action
-> use corresponding local Skill prompt through AGENTS.md soft index
-> map natural language or /xxx alias to workflow action
-> execute phase/task protocol
```

Native Agent skill hydration, when available:

```txt
Client scans its configured skill root
-> semantic matcher selects a SKILL.md before the turn
-> selected Skill instructions hydrate the prompt
```

Harness supports this second path by placing workflow Skills under the configured `<harnessRoot>/skills` tree, but the deterministic lifecycle route does not depend on first-turn native hydration.

Skill sync with project-local role prompt additions:

```txt
Package asset packages/sdlc-harness/assets/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
+ optional <harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/<skill_name>.md
-> sdlc-harness sync
-> <harnessRoot>/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- Hard index means the Agent client itself knows a fixed skill root and can enumerate `SKILL.md` files before the model turn.
- Soft index means project instructions tell the model where to look after reading state, such as `active_skill` in `lifecycle.yaml`.
- Workflow reliability comes from the soft index because it is deterministic and tied to lifecycle state.
- User convenience comes from natural-language routing and macro aliases; users do not need to memorize every `/xxx`.
- `/plan` and `/goal` are client modes and are not automatically controlled by Harness.
- Authoring-only prompts help this repository improve the Harness itself and should not be shipped into user projects by default.
- Package-facing behavior changes must keep both `README.md` and `packages/sdlc-harness/README.md` aligned with the full public capability list, not only `PROJECT_SPEC.md` or release notes.
- Local Skill overrides are append-only in v1. They let projects add role preferences or complete local Skill extensions without replacing lifecycle, task, gate or allowed-path rules from the package Skill.
- `sync` auto-detects a complete Skill override when the override file starts with `name` and `description` frontmatter, validates that `name` matches the target skill, merges the override `description` into the final top-level metadata and appends the stripped body.
- `sync` writes a semantic maintenance note into each generated `Local Override` block so future agents can review phase boundaries, `allowed_paths`, `required_gates`, commit/release rules and completion checks for conflicts.
- `sync` blocks unknown files under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/*.md`, so a misspelled Skill name cannot silently fail to apply.
- `pjsdlc_managed/override_skills` keeps override configuration with other managed workflow configuration while preserving `<harnessRoot>/skills/**` as the shallow hard file index.
- When a user explicitly asks to slice an existing complete PRD/product document or complete tech plan into multiple slices, `pjsdlc_pm_prd` and `pjsdlc_architect_design` now require validating replacement slice coverage, updating `.docs/INDEX.md` and generated `overview.md`, synchronizing `plan.draft.yaml` references for tech plan slicing, and then deleting the superseded complete file so the facts are not duplicated.
- `pjsdlc_pm_prd`, `pjsdlc_architect_design`, `pjsdlc_reviewer`, `pjsdlc_tester`, `pjsdlc_release_manager` and `pjsdlc_rfc_recalibrate` create or resume one small `TASK-*` task before writing phase outputs. `pjsdlc_manager` routes `/prd`, `/design`, `/review`, `/test`, `/release` and `/rfc` through those task protocols and treats remaining open tasks as phase-exit blockers.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Earlier wording treated all workflow role files as native Skills. The current model distinguishes native hard-index hydration from Harness soft-index routing.
- The default authoring root moved from `.agent` to `.codex` after target-agent selection was added.
- DEV-043 consolidated legacy task records for role prompts, skill layout and natural-language control into this module-level doc.

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 2026-05-27 | Direct user request | Working tree | Added complete Skill override merge support with description merging and semantic conflict review guidance. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- When adding a workflow role, update both the Skill file and the soft-index contract in lifecycle/phase policies.
- If a client-specific native skill root is supported, document it as hard-index behavior without assuming every Agent hydrates it identically.
- Do not document direct edits to `<harnessRoot>/skills/**/SKILL.md` as a customization path; use `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/*.md` and `sdlc-harness sync`.

# State and Task Protocol Implementation

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_workflow`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: lifecycle state, plan state, task execution protocol and gate evidence
- Updated by task: `DEV-010`, `DEV-011`, `DEV-018`, `DEV-019`, `DEV-024`, `DEV-025`, `DEV-026`, `DEV-027`, `DEV-028`, `DEV-043`, `DEV-050`, `DEV-056`, `TASK-057`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked RFC: `RFC_004`, `RFC_005`, `RFC_010`, `RFC_011`, `RFC_012`, `RFC_013`, `RFC_014`, `RFC_015`
- Linked commits: historical `DEV-*` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit; `DEV-050` implementation commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- `.codex/state/lifecycle.yaml` stores only the current routing state.
- `.codex/state/plan.yaml` stores the current and future short-lived task contract across all workflow phases.
- `TASK-*` is the new task id model; `phase` identifies `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING`, `ARCHITECTING`, `SPRINTING`, `REVIEWING`, `TESTING`, `RELEASING` or `RFC_RECALIBRATION`; historical `PRD-*`, `DES-*` and `DEV-*` ids remain validator-compatible provenance.
- `next_task_sequence` preserves future `TASK-*` id allocation after done tasks are removed.
- Document, review, test, release and RFC tasks use `result_docs` for planned fact-source outputs; development tasks use `implementation_doc`.
- Checkpoint files, archive directories, gate result logs and lifecycle history are no longer active state facts.
- A SPRINTING task completes in two commits: implementation commit while the task is still present, then completion ledger commit after removing the task.
- Past task details are cold archive and only used for explicit forensic/audit/regression requests.
- `parallel_execution` is an optional top-level plan contract; when omitted the workflow remains serial.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Any workflow phase task starts
-> plan.yaml contains one small TASK-* open task with phase metadata
-> agent edits only allowed_paths for the current slice or plan.draft output
-> result_docs or implementation_doc points to the produced fact source
-> docs index and generated overview are updated
-> validate-plan checks the open task contract during execution
-> phase exit validator runs only after open tasks are removed
```

```txt
SPRINTING task starts
-> plan.yaml contains full open task contract
-> agent edits only allowed_paths
-> required_gates pass
-> related module implementation doc records facts and verification
-> implementation commit is created while task remains in plan.yaml
-> task is removed from plan.yaml
-> completion ledger commit is created
-> both commits are pushed before the next task starts
```

Optional parallel execution:

```txt
User explicitly asks for parallel / multi-agent / multi-worktree
-> main agent creates parallel_execution.trigger = user_requested
-> runtime_managed: main agent spawns subagents when runtime supports it
-> user_orchestrated: main agent outputs worker prompts for manual Codex conversations/worktrees
-> workers operate inside owned_paths and run focused gates
-> main agent reviews, merges/cherry-picks, runs total gates and updates final fact sources
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- `plan.yaml` is intentionally short lived. It is not a historical task database.
- Every phase task is task-controlled: one `TASK-*` task should produce one bounded document slice, review batch, test evidence set, release artifact set, RFC impact slice or development change.
- `validate-plan` permits open tasks and checks their shape; phase exit gates reject remaining open tasks.
- `allowed_paths`, `required_gates` and `working_notes` are execution-time constraints, not a long-term query API.
- Gate evidence belongs in the current task while executing, and in implementation docs, CI logs or release docs after completion.
- `lifecycle.yaml` does not store phase history. Phase history is reconstructed from git, PRs, CI or release evidence only when explicitly needed.
- `/dev` runs one task and stops. `/devloop` repeats `/dev` until no clear task remains or a blocker appears.
- The workflow assumes a singleton project-level Harness collaboration boundary; concurrent agents must coordinate through git and active state rather than independent archive files.
- Parallel execution is opt-in only. `trigger` must be `user_requested`, `mode` must be `runtime_managed` or `user_orchestrated`, and `SPRINTING` contracts must bind `linked_task_id` to `current_task_id`.
- Workers do not own final fact sources. PRD, plan state, implementation docs, test results, generated overviews and total gate evidence are integrated by the main agent.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Early designs used checkpoint files, `.agent/archive/**`, `gate_results.log` and lifecycle `history`; those have been removed from the active state model.
- DEV-043 migrated state/task facts from task-grain implementation docs into this module-level protocol document.

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Do not reintroduce active historical ledgers unless a new RFC explicitly changes the state model.
- If a new workflow action needs durable history, prefer git/tag/release evidence or module implementation docs before adding state files.
