# CLI Distribution and Lifecycle Implementation

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_package`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: CLI package distribution, init/sync/upgrade/doctor lifecycle
- Updated by task: `DEV-001`, `DEV-002`, `DEV-003`, `DEV-005`, `DEV-006`, `DEV-008`, `DEV-009`, `DEV-020`, `DEV-021`, `DEV-022`, `DEV-023`, `DEV-040`, `DEV-041`, `DEV-043`, `DEV-054`, `TASK-058`, `TASK-074`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked RFC: `RFC_001`, `RFC_002`, `RFC_003`, `RFC_006`, `RFC_007`, `RFC_008`, `RFC_009`
- Linked commits: historical `DEV-*` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- `agent-project-sdlc` npm package exposes the `sdlc-harness` CLI binary.
- `init` / `init --adopt` create or adopt a project Harness without overwriting user-owned project code.
- Fresh `init` lifecycle routes new projects to `SPRINTING` with `active_role: "developer"` and `active_skill: "pjsdlc_dev_sprint"`; generated plan files do not duplicate `current_phase`.
- `sync` materializes managed Harness assets from package canonical assets into the selected `<harnessRoot>`.
- `upgrade` refreshes `<harnessRoot>/config.yaml` package identity and schema metadata, runs schema migrations and then syncs managed assets.
- `doctor` reports Harness config, managed file drift, override state and suggested gates. The displayed package version is read from the installed npm package metadata, not from project config.
- `validate-*` commands expose package-side validation entry points for Harness state and phase artifacts.
- 当前 authoring workspace 使用 `.codex` as `harnessFolderName`; `Other` agent selection still falls back to `.agent`.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
User runs sdlc-harness init/init --adopt
-> choose target Agent unless explicit harness folder/config exists
-> resolve <harnessRoot>
-> write config/state/docs scaffold
-> sync package canonical assets
-> doctor reports readiness
```

```txt
Existing project runs sdlc-harness upgrade
-> read current package/config/schema
-> run migrations for root names, managed layout, markers, plan/lifecycle shape
-> sync canonical assets
-> doctor reports remaining drift or blockers
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- Agent selection happens before folder selection. `Codex` is the default and writes `.codex`; `Other` asks for a custom folder and defaults to `.agent`.
- New project lifecycle scaffolding starts at `SPRINTING` and allows `REVIEWING` next. Generated `plan.yaml` stores `current_task_id`, `next_task_sequence` and `tasks`; generated `plan.draft.yaml` stores only draft sequencing and tasks.
- Explicit CLI flags and existing JSON config have higher priority than interactive defaults.
- Managed files use package metadata blocks and merge strategies instead of blind overwrites.
- Package name and CLI name are intentionally separate: npm installs `agent-project-sdlc`, users run `sdlc-harness`.
- Migrations preserve compatibility with earlier `.harness`, `.agents` and `.agent` layouts while converging new installs on the configured `<harnessRoot>`.
- `migrateConfig` rewrites `core.package`, deletes legacy `core.version`, and preserves `core.schema_version`. Package version is intentionally not persisted in project config because the installed package manifest is the source of truth.
- Plan migrations remove stale `current_phase` from active and draft plans, remove draft `current_task_id`, and strip duplicate `phase` / `linked_task_id` from `parallel_execution`.
- Validation commands mirror the Python Harness gates closely enough for package consumers to run health checks without depending on this authoring workspace.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `sdlc-harness` CLI commands (`init`, `sync`, `upgrade`, `doctor`, `validate-*`) and the root `npm run sdlc-harness` adapter.
- Exit / side effects: writes or checks Harness state/assets, reports validator diagnostics, and never publishes or pushes by default.
- Config contract: `package.json#sdlcHarness.harnessFolderName`, `<harnessRoot>/config.yaml` (`core.package`, `core.schema_version`, managed files and local overrides), and package default config.
- Fixture/live boundary: package tests and consumer lab use local fixtures; npm registry publish/smoke remains release-stage live behavior.

## Development Evidence

- Runnable Entry: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc`, `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source`, `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source`, `make validate-dev`, and `make validate-harness` are the task verification entrypoints.
- Observable Exit: `tests/sdlc-harness/sync-init-doctor.test.mjs` asserts generated config omits `core.version` and `doctor` reports `core package: agent-project-sdlc@<installed package version>`; `tests/sdlc-harness/upgrade.test.mjs` asserts migrated config omits legacy `core.version`; `package check-source` output was `package source OK`.
- Basic Self-test Evidence: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` PASS with 10/10 tests; `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source` PASS; `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` PASS.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Earlier plans used `.harness`, `.agents` and then `.agent` as defaults; current behavior is target-agent first, with Codex mapping to `.codex`.
- Historical task docs were written under `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/dev_*.md`; DEV-043 migrated those facts into this module-level doc and sibling module docs.
- TASK-058 is a bug fix to existing `upgrade` metadata persistence; it does not add a public CLI capability, so `README.md`, `packages/sdlc-harness/README.md`, `PROJECT_SPEC.md` and `tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs` did not require updates. Regression coverage lives in `tests/sdlc-harness/upgrade.test.mjs`.

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Future package lifecycle changes should update this document instead of creating task-grain `dev_*.md` implementation docs.
- When CLI behavior changes, keep README user guidance, PRD acceptance criteria and package tests in sync.

# Consumer Lab Validation Implementation

## 1. Linked Facts

- Domain: `harness_package`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: installed-consumer workflow validation
- Updated by task: `DEV-051`, `DEV-052`, `TASK-057`, `TASK-060`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked test evidence: `.docs/07_test/harness_consumer_lab.md`
- External lab repository: `/Users/momoooo/Documents/sdlc-harness-consumer-lab`
- Latest scripted lab evidence commit: not recorded for the 2026-05-27 cleanup run
- Latest scripted lab evidence tag: not recorded for the 2026-05-27 cleanup run

## 2. What Was Built

`DEV-051` created a long-lived local consumer lab repository and installed the current source tarball `agent-project-sdlc@0.1.7` through npm. The lab keeps its own git history and a tiny toy JavaScript module so Harness behavior can be exercised against a real consumer workspace instead of only in source-repo unit fixtures.

`DEV-052` persisted that manual flow as `tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs`, an authoring-only full-lab runner. The script packages the current source workspace, installs the tarball into a consumer repository, exercises the documented package capability surface, writes JSON/Markdown reports, and classifies outcomes as `PASS`, `BLOCKED`, or `FAIL`.

The lab repository contains:

- Packaged Harness assets generated by `npx sdlc-harness init --harness-folder .codex`.
- A local Skill override under `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/`.
- Product, architecture, technical plan, implementation, review, test, release, and RFC documents for a toy text summary helper.
- `src/stringStats.js` and `tests/stringStats.test.mjs`.

The script interface is:

```sh
node tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs --report-only --lab-dir /Users/momoooo/Documents/sdlc-harness-consumer-lab
node tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs --report-only --commit-lab --lab-dir /Users/momoooo/Documents/sdlc-harness-consumer-lab
```

Key options:

- `--lab-dir <path>` selects the long-lived consumer lab.
- `--reset-lab` explicitly deletes and recreates the lab.
- By default, the script deletes the lab repository after reports are written.
- `--keep-lab` explicitly keeps the lab for debugging.
- `--report-only` writes reports and exits 0 even when the result is `BLOCKED`.
- `--commit-lab` explicitly creates a local lab evidence commit and tag, and requires `--keep-lab`.
- `--json-report <path>` and `--markdown-report <path>` override report destinations.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `node tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs` with optional lab/report flags.
- Exit / side effects: creates a temporary consumer repository, installs the local package tarball, writes JSON/Markdown reports, and deletes the lab unless `--keep-lab` is set.
- Config contract: script CLI flags plus the generated consumer `package.json#sdlcHarness.harnessFolderName`.
- Fixture/live boundary: authoring-only installed-consumer fixture; no external publish, tag, push or production deployment occurs unless explicitly requested by script flags.

## 3. Verified Behavior

- Package smoke: `npm pack` and tarball install into the lab.
- Init/adopt/root selection: `init --harness-folder .codex`, `init --adopt`, and `package.json#sdlcHarness.harnessFolderName`.
- Lifecycle commands: `doctor`, `sync`, `upgrade`, and supported CLI validators.
- Managed assets: `AGENTS.md`, `Makefile`, `.codex/state/**`, `.codex/skills/**`, `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/**`, and `.github/workflows/harness.yml`.
- Local customization: Skill override append, unknown Skill override blocking, and local policy preservation.
- Workflow fixtures: PRD, architecture, technical plan, implementation, review, test, release, and RFC docs for the toy helper.
- Design fixture: `plan.draft.yaml` references the toy technical plan through `docs.tech_plan`, so installed-consumer `validate-design` covers the strengthened design slicing contract.
- Protocol checks: retained done task rejection, retained open task rejection, valid explicit `parallel_execution`, and invalid automatic parallel trigger rejection.
- Static checks: natural-language routing text, GitHub workflow asset, and release automation script presence.

## 4. Implementation Findings

The lab exposed a package boundary issue: installed consumers receive Make targets and workflow instructions that invoke `tools/*.py`, but those tools are not included in package assets or generated into the consumer repository.

This means the package currently has two validation surfaces:

- Package CLI validators, which work for `validate-harness`, `validate-current`, `validate-plan`, `validate-pm`, `validate-design`, `validate-dev`, `validate-review`, `validate-test`, `validate-release`, and `validate-rfc`.
- Generated Make targets, which advertise the full lifecycle but fail in a consumer-only repo because `tools/**` is missing.

Overview generation and Makefile gates remain blocked from package-only consumer workflows until either the tools are distributed or CLI coverage replaces those Makefile dependencies.

The scripted report also produces defect candidates and a recommended RFC title whenever `BLOCKED` items remain. This makes the expected follow-up explicit: every full-lab run that finds package behavior gaps should feed RFC recalibration before bug-fix `TASK-*` development tasks.

## 5. Verification

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | PASS |
| `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` | PASS for TASK-060 package validator regression; 9 tests passed |
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` | PASS |
| `node tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs --report-only --reset-lab --lab-dir /Users/momoooo/Documents/sdlc-harness-consumer-lab` | PASS for TASK-060 script execution; CLI `validate-design` PASS; report decision BLOCKED due known Makefile/tools package gap; 37 PASS / 7 BLOCKED / 0 FAIL; lab deleted after run |
| `test ! -e /Users/momoooo/Documents/sdlc-harness-consumer-lab` | PASS after default full lab run |
| Lab supported package capability subset | PASS: 37 checks |
| Lab full documented workflow | BLOCKED: 7 known package gaps, 0 unexpected failures |

## 6. Follow-up

Create an RFC for the package boundary fix before DEV implementation. The implementation should choose one coherent consumer contract:

- distribute the required `tools/**` into consumer repositories,
- rewrite generated Make targets to call the packaged CLI,
- or expand CLI commands and make the Makefile a thin `npx sdlc-harness` wrapper.

Any change to package public behavior, README capabilities, validators, Makefile assets, workflow Skills, sync/upgrade, migrations, release automation, or docs overview generation must also check whether `tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs` and `tests/sdlc-harness/**` need updates.

# Release Automation Implementation

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_package`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: npm release automation and registry smoke
- Updated by task: `DEV-033`, `DEV-035`, `DEV-042`, `DEV-043`, `DEV-047`, `DEV-048`, `TASK-069`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked RFC: none
- Linked commits: `DEV-033`, `DEV-035`, `DEV-042` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit; `338b4b5`; `DEV-048` implementation commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- `tools/release_npm.mjs` automates npm package version bump, gates, publish, registry verification, installed-consumer smoke and current-release status generation.
- `npm run release:npm` is the root script entrypoint.
- The script defaults to prepare/check mode; real publishing requires `--publish --yes`.
- Release evidence is written to `.docs/08_release/CURRENT_RELEASE.md`; each release overwrites the current status instead of creating a versioned docs ledger.
- `packages/sdlc-harness/README.md` is included in the package `files` list so npm displays public install, command, workflow and Skill override documentation.
- Root `README.md` is packaged as `assets/docs/README.md` so installed-package agents can inspect the full user guide from `node_modules` without changing consumer project files.
- Git commit, tag and push remain outside the release script and are handled by the SPRINTING task protocol.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `npm run release:npm -- --version <value>` with optional `--publish --yes`.
- Exit / side effects: prepare mode runs gates and writes the current release status; publish mode can bump package version, publish to npm and perform registry smoke.
- Config contract: package metadata, npm auth/environment, release script flags and Harness docs paths.
- Fixture/live boundary: default behavior is non-publishing prepare/check; live npm publication requires explicit `--publish --yes`.

## 3. 真实代码结构

| 文件（File） | 作用（Purpose） | 关键函数/对象（Key Functions/Objects） |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/release_npm.mjs` | Release automation entrypoint | version resolution, gate runner, publish, smoke, current release status writer |
| `package.json` | Root script adapter | `scripts.release:npm` |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/package.json` | Package version and publish metadata | `version`, `files`, `bin`, `prepack` |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/README.md` | npm registry README | public capability list, command examples, Skill override usage |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/docs/README.md` | Packaged root README asset | agent-readable full user guide copied from root `README.md` |
| `package-lock.json` | Workspace lock version record | `packages/sdlc-harness.version` |
| `.docs/08_release/CURRENT_RELEASE.md` | Current release status | release notes, smoke evidence, deployment checklist, rollback plan, known issues |

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
npm run release:npm -- --version patch --publish --yes
-> resolve next version from local package and npm registry
-> npm version --workspace agent-project-sdlc --no-git-tag-version
-> npm test
-> package check-source
-> npm pack --dry-run --json
-> npm publish
-> npm view latest verification
-> temporary consumer install smoke
-> write .docs/08_release/CURRENT_RELEASE.md
-> make docs-overview
-> make validate-harness
-> git diff --check
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- The script refuses accidental publish unless both `--publish` and `--yes` are present.
- Version selection can be explicit or semantic (`patch`, `minor`, `major`) and is checked against the npm registry.
- Registry smoke validates the published package by installing it into a temporary consumer and running package commands.
- `CURRENT_RELEASE.md` is the active release status fact source. Historical release evidence is reconstructed from git tags, npm registry metadata, CI logs and release commits when explicitly needed.
- Commit and tag creation remain manual/task-driven so release automation cannot bypass Harness task ledger rules.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- The original package plan expected publish evidence to be created manually in the release stage. DEV-035 added a script because repeated package publishing became deterministic enough to automate.
- DEV-042 used the script flow to publish `agent-project-sdlc@0.1.5`.

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 2026-05-29 | `TASK-069` | Working tree | Changed release docs to a single `.docs/08_release/CURRENT_RELEASE.md` current-state contract with legacy validator compatibility. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Keep the release script conservative; publishing must remain explicit.
- If release evidence format changes, update `tools/release_npm.mjs`, `validate-release`, package validators, release Skill/template and `.docs/08_release/CURRENT_RELEASE.md` expectations together.

# Source Sync and Package Assets Implementation

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_package`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: package canonical assets, source sync, managed file materialization
- Updated by task: `DEV-001`, `DEV-004`, `DEV-006`, `DEV-012`, `DEV-013`, `DEV-021`, `DEV-022`, `DEV-023`, `DEV-027`, `DEV-037`, `DEV-038`, `DEV-039`, `DEV-043`, `TASK-073`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked RFC: `RFC_001`, `RFC_007`, `RFC_008`, `RFC_009`, `RFC_013`
- Linked commits: historical `DEV-*` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- The authoring workspace is the source of truth for `AGENTS.md`, root `README.md`, workflow Skills, templates, policies, Makefile include assets and GitHub workflow assets.
- `package sync-source` copies or extracts those source files into `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/**`.
- `package check-source` verifies that package assets have not drifted from authoring sources.
- User-project `sync` materializes package assets into the configured `<harnessRoot>` and project root using managed strategies.
- Authoring-only Skills under `<harnessRoot>/skills/authoring/**` are excluded from package assets.
- User-owned Markdown files may contain fixed package-managed sections. `sync` / `upgrade` update only `memory.md#Harness Guidance` and `.docs/INDEX.md#Harness Maintenance Rules`, while preserving user memory entries, artifact maps and links outside those sections.
- The default GitHub workflow is safely upgradable only when the file has `pjsdlc:sdlc-harness:github-workflow:*` markers or still exactly matches the old generated workflow without markers; customized no-marker workflows are skipped and reported as `customized`.

| `.github/workflows/harness.yml` | Authoring source for package CI asset | workflow asset mapping |
| `tests/sdlc-harness/package-source.test.mjs` | Regression tests for source sync and drift checks | source mapping, excludes, check-source |

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Author edits Harness source files
-> sdlc-harness package sync-source
-> package assets are regenerated
-> sdlc-harness package check-source verifies no drift
-> npm package ships assets
-> user project runs sdlc-harness sync/upgrade
-> managed assets materialize into <harnessRoot> and root files
-> package-managed sections in user-owned Markdown files are merged by heading
-> marker-managed or exact-old GitHub workflow is updated; customized workflow is skipped
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- `AGENTS.md` is synced as an extracted managed block, so project-specific text outside the block remains user-owned.
- Root `README.md` is copied into `assets/docs/README.md` so installed packages expose the full user guide to agents without overwriting a consumer repository README.
- Skills are distributed under `<harnessRoot>/skills`, while policies/templates live under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed`.
- The package keeps a hard source mapping manifest, not a runtime scan of arbitrary repository paths.
- `copy-tree` supports exclude patterns so authoring-only material stays local to this repository.
- Makefile integration is an include block, allowing project-specific targets to win on name conflicts.
- The current package does not guarantee native skill hydration for every Agent. It distributes files in the chosen root and exposes Harness soft routing through `AGENTS.md`.
- `memory.md#Harness Guidance` and `.docs/INDEX.md#Harness Maintenance Rules` use Markdown headings as the package-owned merge boundary. The merge replaces the managed section when present, appends it when missing, and removes known legacy untitled memory guidance / exact legacy index maintenance text to avoid duplicates.
- `sync` runs user-owned guidance section sync regardless of `managed_files` so older configs receive the sections after package updates. `upgrade` also runs the same merge during migrations before its normal sync pass.
- Config migration now backfills the `.github/workflows/harness.yml` managed file entry for older projects, so the safe workflow migration path is reachable after upgrade.
- The sync CLI and upgrade report print customized workflow skips without treating them as blockers.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `sdlc-harness package sync-source`, `sdlc-harness package check-source`, user-project `sdlc-harness init`, `sdlc-harness sync`, and `sdlc-harness upgrade`.
- Exit / side effects: source sync rewrites package assets from authoring sources; check-source reports drift without writing; init/sync/upgrade merge package-managed guidance sections into `memory.md` and `.docs/INDEX.md`; workflow sync writes marker-managed or exact-old generated workflow files and skips customized no-marker workflows.
- Config contract: `packages/sdlc-harness/source-mappings.yaml`, `<harnessRoot>/config.yaml`, and managed-file metadata markers.
- Fixture/live boundary: package-source tests use temporary fixtures; real package asset updates happen only in the authoring workspace.

## Development Evidence

- Runnable Entry: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc`, `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source`, `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source`, and `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js sync` were run from the repository root.
- Observable Exit: package tests passed 10/10; package source check returned `package source OK`; current `.codex/state/memory.md` now has one `## Harness Guidance` section; current `.docs/INDEX.md` now has one `## Harness Maintenance Rules` section; current and packaged `.github/workflows/harness.yml` include `pjsdlc:sdlc-harness:github-workflow:*` markers.
- Basic Self-test Evidence: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` PASS; `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source` PASS with changed assets; `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` PASS; `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js sync` PASS with `changed=3 skipped=12 blocked=0`.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Legacy package layouts referenced `.harness/managed`, `.agents/skills` and `.agent/managed`; current generated assets use `<harnessRoot>/skills` and `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed`.
- DEV-043 removed the legacy implementation-doc directory as an active asset/documentation target; source sync does not treat `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/**` as a maintained path.

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 测试（Test） | 覆盖范围（Coverage） | 最近记录结果（Result） |
|---|---|---|
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source` | Regenerate package canonical assets from authoring source | PASS for `TASK-059`; changed 25 assets |
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` | Asset drift detection | PASS for `TASK-059` |
| `tests/sdlc-harness/package-source.test.mjs` | Mapping modes, excludes and drift errors | PASS in `npm test` |
| `make validate-harness` | Prompt language and generated overview consistency | PASS for DEV-043 |
| `tests/sdlc-harness/sync-init-doctor.test.mjs` | Init/sync generation of memory/index guidance sections, preservation of user content and workflow markers | PASS for `TASK-073` |
| `tests/sdlc-harness/upgrade.test.mjs` | Legacy memory seed migration, missing/custom memory behavior, old generated workflow migration and custom workflow skip | PASS for `TASK-073` |
| `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` | Package regression including sync/init/upgrade safety | PASS for `TASK-073`; 10 tests passed |
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source` | README and GitHub workflow package assets reflect source changes | PASS for `TASK-073` |
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` | Package canonical assets match source after TASK-073 | PASS for `TASK-073` |

## 8. 变更记录（Change Log）

| 日期（Date） | Task ID | Commit | 摘要（Summary） |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-001`, `DEV-004` | Historical implementation commits | Introduced source mappings and package source sync/check commands. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-006` - `DEV-023` | Historical implementation commits | Migrated roots, markers and managed layout to the current package asset shape. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-037` - `DEV-039` | Historical implementation commits | Added authoring Skill boundary and excluded authoring assets from package sync. |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-043` | DEV-043 implementation commit | Consolidated source-sync implementation facts from legacy task docs. |
| 2026-05-27 | Direct user request | Working tree | Added root README as a packaged docs asset for installed-package agent reads. |
| 2026-05-28 | `TASK-059` | Pending implementation commit | Synced source changes that remove duplicate phase/task state from distributed assets. |
| 2026-05-29 | `TASK-073` | Working tree | Added package-managed heading sections for user-owned memory/index files and safe marker/exact-old GitHub workflow migration. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Any change to `.codex/skills/**`, `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/**`, `AGENTS.md`, root `README.md`, Makefile include or CI asset source should be followed by `package sync-source` and `package check-source`.
- If an operation becomes repetitive and deterministic, prefer extracting it into a script and documenting the script here instead of keeping it as manual release/development lore.

# Command Intent Model Implementation Doc

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_workflow`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: natural language and command alias routing
- Updated by task: `DEV-034`, `DEV-036`, `DEV-043`, `DEV-050`, `TASK-057`, `TASK-061`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md` (`PRD-NPM-026`, `PRD-NPM-028`)
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked RFC: `RFC_015`
- Linked commit: `DEV-034` implementation commit, `DEV-036` implementation commit, `DEV-050` implementation commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- 新增（Added）:
  - 自然语言意图和 `/xxx` 宏指令别名作为同一组 workflow action 的双入口协议。
  - `/xxx` 宏指令作为更完整、更细节的提示词别名；简单自然语言作为低成本意图入口。
  - `/prd` 产品方案入口和 `/design` 架构/技术方案入口。
  - `/dev` 单任务开发闭环和 `/devloop` 连续开发循环语义。
  - `/review`、`/test`、`/release` 和 `/rfc` 也通过 `TASK-*` open task 做小步恢复和阶段 gate 管控。
  - `ARCHITECTING` 中的 `/prd` 或“需求要改”可以在开发前回到 `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING`，由 PM workflow 修改 PRD。
  - `/plan`、`/goal` 与 Harness workflow 的配合边界说明。
  - 用户显式要求并行、多 agent 或多 worktree 时，映射到 optional `parallel_execution` 合同。
- 修改（Changed）:
  - `AGENTS.md`、`README.md`、`PROJECT_SPEC.md` 的日常控制说明。
  - `pjsdlc_manager` 的路由规则。
  - `pjsdlc_dev_sprint` 的开发入口规则。
  - PRD 和技术方案中的 Natural Language Control 契约。
- 未覆盖（Not covered）:
  - 不实现 CLI 子命令 `/prd`、`/design`、`/dev` 或 `/devloop`；它们是 Agent 对话层宏指令，不是 `sdlc-harness` binary 参数。
  - 不自动开启 Codex 原生 `/plan` 或 `/goal` 模式。

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: Agent natural-language requests and `/status`, `/next`, `/advance`, `/prd`, `/design`, `/dev`, `/devloop`, `/review`, `/test`, `/release`, `/rfc` macro aliases.
- Exit / side effects: selected workflow Skill updates bounded facts, gates and commits according to the active lifecycle phase.
- Config contract: `.codex/state/lifecycle.yaml`, `.codex/state/plan.yaml`, `AGENTS.md` routing rules and `phase_contracts.yaml`.
- Fixture/live boundary: conversation-level routing protocol; no standalone product runtime or CLI endpoint is introduced.

## 3. 真实代码结构

| 文件（File） | 作用（Purpose） | 关键函数/对象（Key Functions/Objects） |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent 入口协议 | 自然语言与宏指令、`/prd`、`/design`、`/dev`、`/devloop` |
| `README.md` | 用户视角日常使用说明 | 常用快捷入口表 |
| `PROJECT_SPEC.md` | 完整工作流规格 | 宏指令协议、Codex 适配方式 |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_manager/SKILL.md` | 意图路由 Skill | 自然语言到 workflow action 的映射规则 |
| `.codex/skills/pjsdlc_dev_sprint/SKILL.md` | 开发阶段执行 Skill | `/dev` 与 `/devloop` 的执行边界 |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/**` | npm 包 canonical assets | 由 `package sync-source` 同步 |
| `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md` | 产品需求 | `PRD-NPM-026` |
| `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md` | 技术方案 | Natural Language Control |

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
User input
-> Manager reads lifecycle.yaml and plan.yaml
-> Natural language or /xxx detailed skill alias maps to workflow action
-> Stage Skill executes the action
-> Gates and docs update
-> Commit/push protocol records durable history
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- 输入校验（Input validation）: manager 在路由前必须读取 lifecycle 和 plan；如果当前阶段与用户意图冲突，先说明冲突和推荐路径。
- 入口语义（Entry semantics）: `/xxx` 宏指令是更完整、更细节的提示词别名；自然语言入口映射到同一 action，但由 Agent 结合上下文补足细节。
- 核心分支（Core branches）: `/prd` 只在需求阶段推进产品方案；`/design` 只在架构阶段推进 architecture / tech plan；`/dev` 执行一个最小 `TASK-*` development task 后停止；`/review`、`/test`、`/release` 和 `/rfc` 也各执行一个最小 `TASK-*`；`/devloop` 每完成一个 task 后重新读取当前状态，再决定是否继续。
- 开发前 PRD 回退（Pre-development PRD rollback）: 如果当前阶段是 `ARCHITECTING`，用户要求改 PRD 或完善产品方案，Manager 可以先确认没有未收尾的 design task，然后用 `python3 tools/transition.py --to REQUIREMENT_GATHERING` 切回 PM workflow；进入 `SPRINTING` 后同类需求变化必须走 RFC。
- 异常处理（Error handling）: 需求、架构、allowed_paths、gate、commit/push 不清或失败时停止并报告 blocker。
- 边界兜底（Boundary fallback）: `/plan` 和 `/goal` 属于 Codex 客户端模式，Harness 只说明组合方式，不把它们当作可配置 state。
- 性能或并发注意事项（Performance or concurrency notes）: `/devloop` 每轮重新读取状态，避免连续执行时使用过期 plan 或远端状态。
- 并行语义（Parallel semantics）: 并行不是默认入口；只有用户显式提出并行时，Manager 才能创建 `parallel_execution.trigger: "user_requested"`，并根据 runtime 能力选择 `runtime_managed` 或 `user_orchestrated`。

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- 无 runtime 代码偏移；该变更只调整 Agent 行为契约和 package assets。

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 测试（Test） | 覆盖范围（Coverage） | 结果（Result） |
|---|---|---|
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` | package canonical assets 与 source workspace 一致 | PASS |
| `make validate-harness` | Harness scaffold、skill language、doc overview、implementation doc index | PASS |
| `tests/sdlc-harness/transition.test.mjs` | ARCHITECTING 中 `/prd` 类需求可以回退到 PM 阶段，SPRINTING 不可直接回退 | PASS for TASK-061 |
| `python3 tools/validate_allowed_paths.py` | DEV-036 修改范围符合 allowed_paths | PASS |
| `git diff --check` | Markdown/YAML trailing whitespace 和 patch 格式 | PASS |

## 8. 变更记录（Change Log）

| 日期（Date） | Task ID | Commit | 摘要（Summary） |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-034` | `DEV-034` implementation commit | 增加自然语言/指令别名双入口和 `/dev`、`/devloop` 开发入口。 |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-043` | DEV-043 implementation commit | 将当前 workspace path 更新为 `.codex`，并纳入模块级 implementation doc 迁移。 |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-036` | `DEV-036` implementation commit | 澄清宏指令是详细提示词别名，并补齐 `/prd`、`/design` 阶段入口。 |
| 2026-05-27 | `DEV-050` | DEV-050 implementation commit | 增加显式 opt-in 的 parallel execution 意图路由和降级语义。 |
| 2026-05-27 | `TASK-057` | Working tree | 将 Review、测试、发布和 RFC 入口纳入统一 `TASK-*` 小任务路由语义。 |
| 2026-05-28 | `TASK-061` | Working tree | 增加开发前从 `ARCHITECTING` 回到 `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING` 的 `/prd` 和需求变化路由规则。 |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- 后续新增阶段快捷入口时，应同时补自然语言表达和 `/xxx` 详细提示词别名，保持双入口映射到同一 workflow action。
- 如果未来实现真实 CLI command，需明确区分 Agent 对话宏指令和 `sdlc-harness` binary 子命令。

# Documentation Overview and Validation Implementation

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_workflow`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: docs overview generation, documentation indexing and validation
- Updated by task: `DEV-005`, `DEV-015`, `DEV-025`, `DEV-030`, `DEV-032`, `DEV-043`, `TASK-060`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md`
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked RFC: none
- Linked commits: historical `DEV-*` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- `.docs/INDEX.md` is the durable documentation routing table.
- `.docs/<stage>/overview.md` files are generated artifacts and are not hand edited.
- `make docs-overview` regenerates all stage overviews from Markdown slices.
- `make validate-doc-overviews` and `make validate-harness` check that generated overviews are current.
- `make validate-design` excludes generated `overview.md` and `README.md` from design deliverables, validates `plan.draft.yaml` task shape, requires development draft tasks to link existing tech plan slices through `docs.tech_plan`, rejects one shared primary tech plan for multiple development drafts, and requires dedicated architecture slices for explicit cross-cutting themes.
- `tools/validate_task_docs.py` requires every implementation doc slice to be linked from `.docs/INDEX.md`.
- Root README is a user guide; `PROJECT_SPEC.md` carries the heavier product/specification narrative.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `make docs-overview`, `make validate-doc-overviews`, `make validate-harness`, `tools/validate_task_docs.py`, and package-side validators.
- Exit / side effects: overview generation writes `.docs/**/overview.md`; validation commands report stale overview, missing links or gate errors.
- Config contract: `.docs/INDEX.md`, `.docs/**` slice layout and Harness Make targets.
- Fixture/live boundary: local repository documentation validation only; no runtime service or external system is involved.

## 3. 真实代码结构

| 文件（File） | 作用（Purpose） | 关键函数/对象（Key Functions/Objects） |
|---|---|---|
| `.docs/INDEX.md` | Global documentation router | stage map, active artifacts |
| `tools/build_doc_overviews.py` | Generated overview builder/checker | source hash, stage scan, Markdown rendering |
| `tools/harness_utils.py` | Shared local validator utilities | `markdown_deliverables` excludes generated/non-deliverable docs |
| `tools/validate_design.py` | Local ARCHITECTING gate | design deliverables, `plan.draft.yaml`, tech plan slice refs, cross-cutting architecture slices |
| `tools/validate_task_docs.py` | Implementation-doc index validator | implementation doc link check |
| `tools/validate_harness.py` | Harness scaffold validator | structure checks |
| `packages/sdlc-harness/src/lib/validators.ts` | Package CLI validators | `validate-design`, Markdown deliverable filtering, design draft slice checks |
| `Makefile` | Validation command entrypoint | `docs-overview`, `validate-doc-overviews`, `validate-harness` |
| `README.md` | User-facing package guide | install/init/sync/upgrade/commands |
| `PROJECT_SPEC.md` | Maintainer-facing product/specification doc | architecture, workflow and package background |

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Markdown slice changes
-> update .docs/INDEX.md if routing changed
-> make docs-overview
-> generated overview.md files include source hash and slice content
-> make validate-doc-overviews / make validate-harness confirms freshness
```

```txt
ARCHITECTING exit or design regression check
-> tools/validate_design.py / package validate-design scan non-generated architecture and tech plan slices
-> plan.draft.yaml development tasks must reference existing docs.tech_plan slices
-> multiple draft tasks must have distinct primary tech plan slices
-> explicit cross-cutting themes require dedicated architecture slices
```

```txt
Implementation doc slice exists
-> tools/validate_task_docs.py scans .docs/04_implementation/**/*.md
-> each slice must be linked from .docs/INDEX.md
-> each slice must state Runnable Entry/Exit facts or explicit Not applicable
-> missing links fail validate-dev / relevant gates
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- Overview files are deterministic and include every non-overview Markdown slice under their stage directory.
- Generated overviews are for browsing and handoff; Markdown slices and `.docs/INDEX.md` remain the source of truth.
- Design validation now treats generated `overview.md` and `README.md` as non-deliverables, so visual rollups cannot satisfy architecture or tech plan slice requirements.
- `plan.draft.yaml` is part of the design gate because task granularity must line up with tech plan fact granularity before SPRINTING starts.
- Cross-cutting architecture validation uses conservative trigger phrases from PRD, tech plan and draft task text, then requires different architecture docs for different triggered categories.
- Implementation docs are validated as module/subsystem/core-flow slices, not task ledgers, and must include runnable entry/exit facts so TESTING receives stable boundaries.
- DEV-043 removes the legacy `npm_package/dev_*.md` docs from the active docs graph and replaces them with module-level slices.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Early documentation used task-grain implementation docs. The current model uses module-level implementation docs and treats git history as the task action record.
- `README.md` was split from the full product specification so npm package users see a lightweight guide first.

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 测试（Test） | 覆盖范围（Coverage） | 最近记录结果（Result） |
|---|---|---|
| `make docs-overview` | Regenerate all `.docs/<stage>/overview.md` files | PASS for DEV-043 |
| `make validate-doc-overviews` | Check generated overview freshness | PASS for DEV-043 |
| `make validate-harness` | Harness scaffold, prompt language and overview checks | PASS for DEV-043 |
| `make validate-design` | Design deliverable filtering, draft task tech plan refs and architecture slice checks | PASS for TASK-060 |
| `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` | Package validator regression, including design slice hard-gate cases | PASS for TASK-060; 9 tests passed |
| `python3 tools/validate_task_docs.py` | Implementation docs are linked from `.docs/INDEX.md` | Covered by validate-dev and manual checks |

## 8. 变更记录（Change Log）

| 日期（Date） | Task ID | Commit | 摘要（Summary） |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-015` | Historical implementation commit | Added deterministic Markdown overview generation. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-025` | Historical implementation commit | Tightened implementation doc indexing in validation. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-030` | Historical implementation commit | Split lightweight README from full product/specification content. |
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-032` | Historical implementation commit | Defined implementation docs as module/subsystem/core-flow facts. |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-043` | DEV-043 implementation commit | Removed task-grain implementation docs from the active implementation-doc graph. |
| 2026-05-28 | `TASK-060` | Working tree | Strengthened `validate-design` so generated overviews do not count as deliverables, draft development tasks must link tech plan slices, shared monolithic primary tech plans fail for multiple draft tasks, and explicit cross-cutting themes require dedicated architecture slices. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Never edit `overview.md` directly; regenerate it.
- When a doc slice is moved or renamed, update `.docs/INDEX.md` in the same task.

# Implementation Doc Model

## 1. 关联信息

- Domain: `harness_workflow`
- Module / subsystem / core flow: implementation documentation model
- Updated by task: `DEV-032`, `DEV-043`, `TASK-057`
- Linked PRD: `.docs/01_product/npm_package_distribution.md` (`PRD-NPM-025`)
- Linked technical design: `.docs/03_tech_plan/harness_package_distribution.md`
- Linked RFC: none
- Linked commit: `DEV-032` implementation commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- 新增（Added）:
  - implementation doc 默认按模块、子系统或核心数据流切片的协议。
  - implementation doc template 中的 provenance 和 Change Log 字段。
  - 技术方案中的 implementation doc model 说明。
- 修改（Changed）:
  - `pjsdlc_implementation_doc` 不再默认按 task 生成 `dev_*.md`。
  - `pjsdlc_dev_sprint` 将 development task 定义为执行和提交边界，将 implementation doc 定义为长期事实边界。
  - `pjsdlc_architect_design` 和 plan/tech templates 引导 future development task 指向模块级 implementation doc；非开发 task 使用 `result_docs` 指向对应阶段产物。
  - AGENTS、PROJECT_SPEC、PRD 和 tech plan 使用同一套语义。
  - DEV-043 将历史 `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/dev_*.md` task log 合并为模块、子系统和核心数据流级 implementation docs，并从活跃实现文档图中移除 legacy 目录。

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `pjsdlc_implementation_doc` prompt usage and `tools/validate_task_docs.py` / package `validate-dev` checks.
- Exit / side effects: implementation docs record module facts, verification and runnable boundaries; validators fail when implementation slices omit required entry/exit facts.
- Config contract: `.docs/04_implementation/**/*.md`, `.docs/INDEX.md`, implementation doc template and dev task `implementation_doc` fields.
- Fixture/live boundary: documentation model only; product runtime behavior must be implemented in the owning development module before testing.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Architecting
-> plan.draft.yaml task includes implementation_doc path
-> SPRINTING executes task as bounded work unit
-> gates pass
-> implementation_doc updates module/subsystem/core-flow fact slice
-> task id + commit recorded as provenance
-> task removed from plan.yaml
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- 输入校验（Input validation）: development open task 使用 `implementation_doc` 指向长期实现事实文档，而不是默认 `dev_*.md` task ledger；文档、Review、测试、发布和 RFC task 使用 `result_docs`。
- 核心分支（Core branches）: 修改已有模块时更新已有 implementation doc；新增稳定模块或核心数据流时创建新文档；一个 task 可更新多份相关文档。
- 异常处理（Error handling）: 若真实代码边界与 architecture / tech plan 不一致，implementation doc 必须记录 deviation，并更新 `.docs/INDEX.md`。
- 边界兜底（Boundary fallback）: 只有当 task 本身就是稳定模块/数据流边界时，implementation doc 才可以与单个 task 一一对应。
- 性能或并发注意事项（Performance or concurrency notes）: 不适用；该改动只调整 workflow 文档模型和分发资产。

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- 早期技术方案和历史 task breakdown 中的 implementation doc 路径以 `dev_*.md` 为主；DEV-032 将其定义为 legacy task log，不再作为未来默认。
- DEV-043 完成历史合并迁移，删除活跃 `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/` task-log 目录，并将事实合并到模块级 implementation docs。

## 7. 测试覆盖（Test Coverage）

| 测试（Test） | 覆盖范围（Coverage） | 结果（Result） |
|---|---|---|
| `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` | package canonical assets 与 source workspace 一致 | PASS |
| `make validate-harness` | Harness scaffold、skill language、doc overview、implementation doc index | PASS |
| `python3 tools/validate_allowed_paths.py` | DEV-032 修改范围符合 allowed_paths | PASS |
| `git diff --check` | Markdown/YAML trailing whitespace 和 patch 格式 | PASS |

## 8. 变更记录（Change Log）

| 日期（Date） | Task ID | Commit | 摘要（Summary） |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-25 | `DEV-032` | `DEV-032` implementation commit | 将 implementation doc 默认粒度从 task 调整为模块、子系统或核心数据流。 |
| 2026-05-26 | `DEV-043` | DEV-043 implementation commit | 将 legacy `npm_package/dev_*.md` task log 合并进模块级 implementation docs，并更新索引和引用。 |
| 2026-05-27 | `TASK-057` | Working tree | 明确只有 development task 使用 `implementation_doc`，其它阶段 task 使用 `result_docs`。 |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- 后续新 task 应优先更新相关模块级 implementation doc；不要默认新增 `dev_*.md`。
- 不要在 `.docs/04_implementation/` 下重新建立 task-grain ledger；task 历史动作记录以 git commit/tag/release evidence 为准。

## 2. 当前实现范围

- Workflow roles are represented as local Skills under `<harnessRoot>/skills/pjsdlc_*/SKILL.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` provides the deterministic soft index from lifecycle state to `active_skill`.
- Native Agent skill hydration, when supported by the client, is a separate hard-index mechanism based on the client-specific skill root.
- Natural language intent and `/xxx` macro aliases map to the same workflow actions.
- Project-local role prompt additions live under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/<skill_name>.md` and are appended to managed Skill output by `sdlc-harness sync`.
- Override files support plain snippets and complete `SKILL.md` extensions with `name`/`description` frontmatter; complete extensions merge their `description` into final Skill metadata and append their body after stripping override frontmatter.
- The generated `Local Override` block tells maintainers and downstream agents to check the merged Skill for semantic conflicts between package base rules and project-local override rules.
- This authoring repository keeps a private authoring Skill under `.codex/skills/authoring/**`; package source sync excludes it from user projects.
- The authoring Skill requires README/package README coverage to stay aligned with all public package capabilities.
- PM, Manager, Dev and Tester prompts now describe optional parallel execution semantics and keep final fact-source integration with the main agent.
- PM and Architect prompts require deleting the superseded monolithic PRD/product or tech plan file after user-requested slicing creates replacement slices and updates the related fact-source references.
- Architect prompt now treats semantic design slicing as a `make validate-design` hard gate: `plan.draft.yaml` development tasks must reference `docs.tech_plan`, multiple draft tasks need distinct primary tech plan slices, generated `overview.md` cannot satisfy design deliverables, and explicit cross-cutting themes require dedicated architecture slices.
- Manager, PM and Architect prompts now describe the development-before rollback path from `ARCHITECTING` to `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING` for PRD edits, while preserving RFC workflow for changes after `SPRINTING`.
- PM, Architect, Reviewer, Tester, Release and RFC prompts now require each main workflow action to run as one small `TASK-*` `plan.yaml` task with `phase` metadata. This covers conversational generation, existing-document slicing, synthesis from prior fact sources, review batches, test evidence, release preparation and RFC recalibration.
- Dev, Review, Tester and Implementation Doc prompts now treat runnable entry/exit as a hard phase boundary: SPRINTING must implement or block promised API/CLI/adapter/provider/config/fixture-live boundaries, REVIEWING must block missing entry/exit, and TESTING may only exercise existing entrypoints.
- Review, test and implementation templates include runnable entry/exit sections. `validate-review` and `validate-test` require entry/exit evidence text, and TESTING validators reject runtime, bootstrap, provider, deploy or package runtime script changes.
- TESTING distinguishes `.docs/07_test/TEST_STRATEGY.md`, `.docs/07_test/TEST_CASES.md` and `.docs/07_test/TEST_REPORT.md`; `TEST_REPORT.md` is execution-only evidence and `validate-test` no longer falls back to `TEST_PLAN.md`.
- RFC recalibration now records `Test Fact Source Impact` and removes superseded `.docs/07_test/**` files from current test facts and `.docs/INDEX.md` when a route, entry/exit or acceptance boundary changes.
- `validate-dev` now requires implementation docs to include `Runnable Entry/Exit` facts or explicit `Not applicable`, so missing runtime boundaries cannot be deferred into TESTING by omission.
- `validate-dev` now requires the current open SPRINTING task implementation doc to include structured `Development Evidence`: `Runnable Entry`, `Observable Exit`, `Basic Self-test Evidence`, or a justified `Not applicable`.
- `validate-dev` now treats service / agent / runtime readiness as stronger than provider or fixture smoke: current task evidence must include `Client / Server Initialization` and `Config Contract`, and provider smoke, fixture smoke, fake adapter or one-shot smoke cannot alone satisfy application readiness.
- `validate-dev` now promotes runtime readiness into the task contract: runtime/app/provider/live SPRINTING tasks declare `evidence_level.required` and `target_runtime_environment`, `deployed_runtime` cannot be closed by lower-level smoke, and `business_handoff_ready` requires a Testing Handoff Contract.
- `validate-design` and `validate-dev` now enforce `self_test_contract`: design binds runnable-boundary tasks to a tech plan `Development Self-Test Contract`, and development requires a completed implementation doc `Development Self-Test Report` before handoff.
- Development Self-Test Contract / Report now require `module_key_test_path` / `Module Key Test Path`, recording the module key test path from local start or invocation to all self-test scenarios completion. The path is scoped to the current task/module and covers promised runnable entries, internal key paths, boundaries, checkpoints and observable completion evidence for later debug reuse.
- `validate-rfc` now requires `Development Self-Test Impact` for new RFCs that change entry/exit, runtime, gates, handoff or blocker semantics.
- `validate-review` now requires explicit PASS/BLOCKED readiness fields for `Runnable Entry`, `Observable Exit`, `Initialization`, `Config Contract` and `Testing Handoff Readiness`; any `BLOCKED` field blocks TESTING handoff.
- `validate-review` and `validate-test` now reject `PASS` reports that acknowledge runtime/handoff mismatch, missing deployment, missing initialization, local-only evidence or fake adapters.
- `validate-test` now rejects `PASS` reports that acknowledge missing runnable entry/exit or missing `Development Evidence`; TESTING must report `BLOCKED` with recovery conditions instead.
- Dev and Manager prompts now distinguish direct SPRINTING `validate-dev` from phase-exit `validate-current`: direct dev gate allows a valid current open task, while phase advancement still requires no open tasks.
- RELEASING uses `.docs/08_release/CURRENT_RELEASE.md` as the canonical current release status. `validate-release` keeps accepting legacy versioned release docs when the current file is absent, but new release work updates the current status file instead of creating a version ledger.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: workflow Skills under `<harnessRoot>/skills/**`, managed templates/policies, Python validators, package `validate-*` commands and package source sync.
- Exit / side effects: updated prompts and validators govern phase behavior; `package sync-source` materializes distributable assets.
- Config contract: `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/**`, `packages/sdlc-harness/source-mappings.yaml`, `.docs/07_test/TEST_REPORT.md`.
- Fixture/live boundary: workflow contract only; TESTING may add fixtures/mocks/assertions/smoke runners under `tests/**` but cannot introduce product runtime/provider/bootstrap/deploy code.

## Development Evidence

- Runnable Entry: CLI command `npx sdlc-harness validate-dev` / `make validate-dev` validates the current SPRINTING task evidence contract through `packages/sdlc-harness/src/lib/validators.ts`.
- Observable Exit: Validator output reports PASS or concrete errors for missing `Development Evidence`, missing `Observable Exit`, missing `Client / Server Initialization`, missing `Config Contract`, missing `Basic Self-test Evidence`, missing `Module Key Test Path`, insufficient lower-level smoke, UI evidence gaps, or callable invocation/result gaps.
- Evidence Level: current task contract requires `local_runtime`; validator source and package CLI execute as local runtime checks.
- Target Runtime Environment: current task contract uses `local` with `npx sdlc-harness validate-dev` as the handoff entrypoint.
- Client / Server Initialization: service / agent / runtime tasks must record startup, live entrypoint, health/status, endpoint, CLI command or worker command evidence.
- Config Contract: service / agent / runtime tasks must record required env/config/API key inputs or an explicit no-config contract.
- Testing Handoff Readiness: package validator errors identify whether a task is ready for Review/Testing handoff or must remain in SPRINTING/RFC.
- Known Missing Runtime Boundaries: none for the Harness validator module; product runtimes in consumer projects are represented by task contracts rather than owned by this repository runtime.
- Basic Self-test Evidence: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` covers validator regression for TASK-079 after completion; final source sync and Harness gates are recorded in Test Coverage.
- Not applicable: not applicable only when a module has no product runtime boundary; this workflow validator module has CLI validator entrypoints, so structured evidence is required.

## Testing Handoff Contract

- Entry: `npx sdlc-harness validate-dev` or `make validate-dev`.
- Config: no secrets; harness root comes from `package.json#sdlcHarness.harnessFolderName` or `sdlc-harness.config.json#harnessFolderName`.
- Initialization / health: package CLI starts through Node and reads lifecycle/plan/implementation docs.
- Input sample: a SPRINTING task with `evidence_level.required`, `target_runtime_environment`, implementation doc and Development Evidence.
- Expected exit / observable side effect: PASS output or concrete validator errors for evidence level, target runtime, handoff entrypoint or Testing Handoff Contract mismatch.
- Cleanup / reset / idempotency: validator is read-only; repeated runs are idempotent.
- Evidence Level: `local_runtime`.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Agent starts work
-> read .codex/state/lifecycle.yaml
-> read active_skill unless user requested another workflow action
-> use corresponding local Skill prompt through AGENTS.md soft index
-> map natural language or /xxx alias to workflow action
-> execute phase/task protocol
```

Native Agent skill hydration, when available:

```txt
Client scans its configured skill root
-> semantic matcher selects a SKILL.md before the turn
-> selected Skill instructions hydrate the prompt
```

Harness supports this second path by placing workflow Skills under the configured `<harnessRoot>/skills` tree, but the deterministic lifecycle route does not depend on first-turn native hydration.

Skill sync with project-local role prompt additions:

```txt
Package asset packages/sdlc-harness/assets/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
+ optional <harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/<skill_name>.md
-> sdlc-harness sync
-> <harnessRoot>/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- Hard index means the Agent client itself knows a fixed skill root and can enumerate `SKILL.md` files before the model turn.
- Soft index means project instructions tell the model where to look after reading state, such as `active_skill` in `lifecycle.yaml`.
- Workflow reliability comes from the soft index because it is deterministic and tied to lifecycle state.
- User convenience comes from natural-language routing and macro aliases; users do not need to memorize every `/xxx`.
- `/plan` and `/goal` are client modes and are not automatically controlled by Harness.
- Authoring-only prompts help this repository improve the Harness itself and should not be shipped into user projects by default.
- Package-facing behavior changes must keep both `README.md` and `packages/sdlc-harness/README.md` aligned with the full public capability list, not only `PROJECT_SPEC.md` or release status notes.
- Local Skill overrides are append-only in v1. They let projects add role preferences or complete local Skill extensions without replacing lifecycle, task, gate or allowed-path rules from the package Skill.
- `sync` auto-detects a complete Skill override when the override file starts with `name` and `description` frontmatter, validates that `name` matches the target skill, merges the override `description` into the final top-level metadata and appends the stripped body.
- `sync` writes a semantic maintenance note into each generated `Local Override` block so future agents can review phase boundaries, `allowed_paths`, `required_gates`, commit/release rules and completion checks for conflicts.
- `sync` blocks unknown files under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/*.md`, so a misspelled Skill name cannot silently fail to apply.
- `pjsdlc_managed/override_skills` keeps override configuration with other managed workflow configuration while preserving `<harnessRoot>/skills/**` as the shallow hard file index.
- When a user explicitly asks to slice an existing complete PRD/product document or complete tech plan into multiple slices, `pjsdlc_pm_prd` and `pjsdlc_architect_design` now require validating replacement slice coverage, updating `.docs/INDEX.md` and generated `overview.md`, synchronizing `plan.draft.yaml` references for tech plan slicing, and then deleting the superseded complete file so the facts are not duplicated.
- `pjsdlc_architect_design` now states that `make validate-design` hard-checks draft task `docs.tech_plan`, distinct primary tech plan slices, generated overview exclusion and dedicated architecture slices for explicit cross-cutting themes.
- `pjsdlc_manager`, `pjsdlc_pm_prd` and `pjsdlc_architect_design` share the same routing rule: PRD changes discovered in `ARCHITECTING` can return to `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING`; PRD changes discovered in `SPRINTING` or later use RFC recalibration.
- `pjsdlc_pm_prd`, `pjsdlc_architect_design`, `pjsdlc_reviewer`, `pjsdlc_tester`, `pjsdlc_release_manager` and `pjsdlc_rfc_recalibrate` create or resume one small `TASK-*` task before writing phase outputs. `pjsdlc_manager` routes `/prd`, `/design`, `/review`, `/test`, `/release` and `/rfc` through those task protocols and treats remaining open tasks as phase-exit blockers.
- SPRINTING Definition of Done now includes runnable entry/exit for promised API, CLI, server route, adapter, worker, provider, config contract and fixture/live boundaries. Missing entry/exit remains a dev/RFC blocker instead of becoming testing work.
- REVIEWING validates entry/exit readiness before TESTING. TESTING validates through existing entrypoints only and blocks product runtime, package runtime script, long-running runtime, systemd, cloud bootstrap, provider adapter and deploy/script changes.
- `validate-test` requires `.docs/07_test/TEST_REPORT.md`, rejects placeholder report text, and requires test matrix, regression evidence, coverage gaps, runnable entry/exit coverage and PASS/BLOCKED decision text.
- `validate-plan` rejects non-`TESTING`/`RFC_RECALIBRATION` tasks that target `.docs/07_test/**`, so SPRINTING cannot create formal test facts before entry/exit delivery.
- `validate-rfc` checks `Test Fact Source Impact` and rejects RFCs that list superseded `.docs/07_test/**` paths still present in current facts or `.docs/INDEX.md`.
- TESTING boundary checks still reject `tests/runtime/**` and runtime-like test files, but allow clearly test-only fixture, mock, assertion and smoke files under `tests/**`.
- `validate-dev` checks implementation docs for runnable entry/exit facts, accepting explicit `Not applicable` only when the module truly has no product runtime boundary.
- `validate-dev` checks the current open SPRINTING task implementation doc for a `Development Evidence` section with concrete `Runnable Entry`, `Observable Exit`, `Client / Server Initialization`, `Config Contract` and `Basic Self-test Evidence`, or a justified `Not applicable`.
- `validate-design` checks runnable-boundary draft tasks for `self_test_contract` and verifies the referenced tech plan slice contains a `Development Self-Test Contract`.
- `validate-dev` checks `self_test_contract.required_gates` against task `required_gates`, requires every contract scenario to have a `PASS` result in `Development Self-Test Report`, and rejects `BLOCKED` self-test scenarios as unfinished development.
- `validate-design` and `validate-dev` require `module_key_test_path` / `Module Key Test Path` so the implementation doc records the local-start-to-self-test-completion module key test path, including current task/module runnable entries, internal key paths, boundaries, checkpoints and completion evidence for future debug.
- `validate-rfc` requires `Development Self-Test Impact` in RFC files from `RFC_023` onward when they mention entry/exit, runtime, target environment, gates, handoff or blockers.
- `validate-dev` rejects service / agent / runtime tasks whose evidence only proves provider smoke, fixture smoke, fake adapter or one-shot smoke without application readiness or `BLOCKED`.
- `validate-review` checks structured readiness fields and treats any `BLOCKED` field as a gate blocker.
- `validate-test` rejects `PASS` reports that still describe missing entry/exit or missing Development Evidence.
- Page evidence must include a dev server/page URL plus browser, Playwright, screenshot or equivalent interaction evidence; API/CLI/worker/RPA evidence must include an invocation command/endpoint and observable output, response, side effect, log, artifact or PASS/BLOCKED result.
- direct `validate-dev` is explicitly an in-development SPRINTING gate. It validates the current open task contract, dirty-file scope, draft consumption and implementation docs without forcing task removal. `validate-current` / `/advance` keeps no-open phase-exit behavior before REVIEWING.
- Managed Makefile `validate-dev` runs `$(SDLC_HARNESS) validate-dev`, then project `lint` and `test-current-domain`, so installed package consumers no longer need source-repo-only Python validators for this gate.
- Package Skill overrides remain append-only local extensions. The generated override block now states that package-managed phase boundaries remain authoritative and overrides may narrow local behavior but must not expand TESTING or REVIEWING into implementation/runtime ownership.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Earlier wording treated all workflow role files as native Skills. The current model distinguishes native hard-index hydration from Harness soft-index routing.
- The default authoring root moved from `.agent` to `.codex` after target-agent selection was added.
- DEV-043 consolidated legacy task records for role prompts, skill layout and natural-language control into this module-level doc.

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- When adding a workflow role, update both the Skill file and the soft-index contract in lifecycle/phase policies.
- If a client-specific native skill root is supported, document it as hard-index behavior without assuming every Agent hydrates it identically.
- Do not document direct edits to `<harnessRoot>/skills/**/SKILL.md` as a customization path; use `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/*.md` and `sdlc-harness sync`.

- Linked commits: historical `DEV-*` implementation commits; `DEV-043` migration commit; `DEV-050` implementation commit

## 2. 当前实现范围

- `.codex/state/lifecycle.yaml` stores the single source for current phase routing state.
- `.codex/state/plan.yaml` stores the current and future short-lived task contract across all workflow phases, without duplicating `current_phase`.
- `plan.yaml` is conceptually a recoverable task-splitting container for long-running project goals; the default Harness workflow only interprets phase-related tasks, while broader project-specific task definitions belong in local configuration or overlays.
- `.codex/state/plan.draft.yaml` is the current built-in draft queue; it stores only unadopted development draft tasks and `next_task_sequence`, without `current_phase` or `current_task_id`.
- `TASK-*` is the new task id model; `phase` identifies `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING`, `ARCHITECTING`, `SPRINTING`, `REVIEWING`, `TESTING`, `RELEASING` or `RFC_RECALIBRATION`; historical `PRD-*`, `DES-*` and `DEV-*` ids remain validator-compatible provenance.
- `next_task_sequence` preserves future `TASK-*` id allocation after done tasks are removed.
- Document, review, test, release and RFC tasks use `result_docs` for planned fact-source outputs; development tasks use `implementation_doc`.
- Checkpoint files, archive directories, gate result logs and lifecycle history are no longer active state facts.
- `.codex/state/memory.md` is a short cross-stage reminder and navigation surface; complete decision context, alternatives, rationale and consequences belong in `.docs/05_decisions/` ADRs or other formal `.docs/**` fact sources.
- `.docs/05_decisions/` is not a lifecycle phase; it is an `ARCHITECTING`-produced ADR fact source for durable architecture decisions that may outlive a single architecture or tech plan slice.
- `phase_contracts.yaml` supports optional `returns` targets for bounded pre-development rollback; the default contract allows `ARCHITECTING -> REQUIREMENT_GATHERING` so PRD facts can be corrected before `SPRINTING`.
- A SPRINTING task completes in two commits: implementation commit while the task is still present, then completion ledger commit after removing the task.
- Generic draft-to-plan rule: when any workflow promotes a draft into a formal `TASK-*`, it removes the source draft in the same state update; the current built-in implementation point is SPRINTING consuming `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]`.
- Past task details are cold archive and only used for explicit forensic/audit/regression requests.
- Release history is also cold archive. `.docs/08_release/CURRENT_RELEASE.md` stores only the current release status; older release evidence is reconstructed from git tags, registry metadata, CI, release commits or external release systems.
- `parallel_execution` is an optional top-level plan contract; when omitted the workflow remains serial. It does not store `phase` or `linked_task_id`; validators infer phase from lifecycle and task selection from `current_task_id`.
- Direct `validate-dev` is the SPRINTING in-development gate. It allows a valid current open `phase: "SPRINTING"` task, checks scoped dirty files and draft consumption, and rejects missing current-task contracts.
- `validate-current` and `tools/run_current_gate.py` keep phase-exit safety: after the phase gate runs, `plan.yaml` must have no open tasks before lifecycle advancement.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `.codex/state/plan.yaml`, `.codex/state/plan.draft.yaml`, lifecycle phase transitions and `validate-plan` / direct `validate-dev` / phase-exit `validate-current` gates.
- Exit / side effects: validators accept or reject task contracts, draft consumption and phase-exit readiness; SPRINTING writes implementation and completion ledger commits.
- Config contract: task fields (`phase`, `allowed_paths`, `required_gates`, `result_docs`, `implementation_doc`) and lifecycle `current_phase`.
- Fixture/live boundary: workflow state protocol only; no product runtime is owned by plan state itself.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Any workflow phase task starts
-> plan.yaml contains one small TASK-* open task with phase metadata
-> agent edits only allowed_paths for the current slice or plan.draft output
-> result_docs or implementation_doc points to the produced fact source
-> docs index and generated overview are updated
-> validate-plan checks the open task contract during execution
-> phase exit validator runs only after open tasks are removed
```

```txt
ARCHITECTING discovers PRD needs revision before development
-> transition.py reads phase_contracts.yaml#phases.ARCHITECTING.returns
-> python3 tools/transition.py --to REQUIREMENT_GATHERING is legal without --force
-> lifecycle active_role/active_skill become pm/pjsdlc_pm_prd
-> PM updates PRD through one REQUIREMENT_GATHERING task and validate-pm
-> transition.py --to ARCHITECTING resumes design
```

```txt
SPRINTING task starts
-> if no open task exists, agent may promote one plan.draft.yaml task into a formal TASK-* and delete the source draft
-> plan.yaml contains full open task contract
-> agent edits only allowed_paths
-> direct validate-dev may run while the current task remains open
-> required_gates pass
-> related module implementation doc records facts and verification
-> implementation commit is created while task remains in plan.yaml
-> task is removed from plan.yaml
-> completion ledger commit is created
-> validate-current can pass only after no open task remains
-> both commits are pushed before the next task starts
```

Optional parallel execution:

```txt
User explicitly asks for parallel / multi-agent / multi-worktree
-> main agent creates parallel_execution.trigger = user_requested
-> runtime_managed: main agent spawns subagents when runtime supports it
-> user_orchestrated: main agent outputs worker prompts for manual Codex conversations/worktrees
-> workers operate inside owned_paths and run focused gates
-> main agent reviews, merges/cherry-picks, runs total gates and updates final fact sources
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- `plan.yaml` is intentionally short lived. It is not a historical task database.
- `plan.yaml` is not an exhaustive log of everything an Agent does. The generic workflow contract covers tasks that affect phase deliverables, gates, implementation facts or RFC recalibration; local teams may extend task taxonomy for broader project management needs without changing the core `TASK-*` workflow semantics.
- `current_phase` belongs only to `lifecycle.yaml`; `plan.yaml`, `plan.draft.yaml` and `parallel_execution` must not duplicate it.
- `transition.py` derives legal targets from the current phase's `next`, optional `returns`, `allowed_next_phases`, RFC/BLOCKED special routes and BLOCKED resume rules. After transition, `allowed_next_phases` is regenerated from the target phase's `next` plus `returns`.
- Draft queues are not active execution state and must not retain adopted or completed drafts. The current built-in draft queue is `plan.draft.yaml`; it must not contain `current_task_id`.
- direct `validate-dev` rejects any remaining `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]`; agents must either continue promoting real unadopted drafts or remove already-consumed stale drafts before development completion.
- direct `validate-dev` requires lifecycle `current_phase: "SPRINTING"` and allows either an empty development queue or one valid current open `phase: "SPRINTING"` task with `current_task_id`, `docs`, `allowed_paths`, `required_gates`, `acceptance_criteria` and `implementation_doc`.
- `validate-dev` enforces dirty-file scoping when a current open task exists; changes outside the current task `allowed_paths` fail the direct dev gate.
- ADRs solve the long-term "why this option, not another" problem. Architecture and tech plan slices may keep local rationale, but decisions with alternatives, cross-module or cross-stage impact, high reversal cost or future supersede semantics belong in `.docs/05_decisions/`.
- `memory.md` must not become a decision ledger. It may point to ADRs, PRDs, tech plans or implementation docs, but detailed context, alternatives, tradeoffs and consequences remain in those formal fact sources.
- Field audit: `active_role`, `active_skill`, `current_milestone`, `blocked_reason`, `suspended_phase` and `allowed_next_phases` are lifecycle-only; `current_task_id` and `next_task_sequence` are plan-only; `tasks[].phase` is semantic task classification rather than current lifecycle state and remains on each task.
- Every phase task is task-controlled: one `TASK-*` task should produce one bounded document slice, review batch, test evidence set, release artifact set, RFC impact slice or development change.
- `validate-plan` permits open tasks and checks their shape; phase exit gates reject remaining open tasks. In `SPRINTING`, this no-open rule lives in `validate-current` and `tools/run_current_gate.py`, not in direct `validate-dev`.
- `allowed_paths`, `required_gates` and `working_notes` are execution-time constraints, not a long-term query API.
- Gate evidence belongs in the current task while executing, and in implementation docs, CI logs, current release status or external release systems after completion.
- `lifecycle.yaml` does not store phase history. Phase history is reconstructed from git, PRs, CI, registry metadata, tags or external release evidence only when explicitly needed.
- `/dev` runs one task and stops. `/devloop` repeats `/dev` until neither `plan.yaml.tasks[]` nor `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]` contains a clear next task, or a blocker appears.
- The workflow assumes a singleton project-level Harness collaboration boundary; concurrent agents must coordinate through git and active state rather than independent archive files.
- Parallel execution is opt-in only. `trigger` must be `user_requested`, `mode` must be `runtime_managed` or `user_orchestrated`, and validators reject duplicate `phase` / `linked_task_id` fields in the contract.
- Workers do not own final fact sources. PRD, plan state, implementation docs, test results, generated overviews and total gate evidence are integrated by the main agent.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Early designs used checkpoint files, `.agent/archive/**`, `gate_results.log` and lifecycle `history`; those have been removed from the active state model.
- DEV-043 migrated state/task facts from task-grain implementation docs into this module-level protocol document.

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Do not reintroduce active historical ledgers unless a new RFC explicitly changes the state model.
- If a new workflow action needs durable history, prefer git, tags, registry/CI/release systems or module implementation docs before adding state files.
