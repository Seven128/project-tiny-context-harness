## 2. 当前实现范围

- `.codex/state/lifecycle.yaml` stores the single source for current phase routing state.
- `.codex/state/plan.yaml` stores the current and future short-lived task contract across all workflow phases, without duplicating `current_phase`.
- `.codex/state/plan.draft.yaml` stores draft tasks and `next_task_sequence`, without `current_phase` or `current_task_id`.
- `TASK-*` is the new task id model; `phase` identifies `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING`, `ARCHITECTING`, `SPRINTING`, `REVIEWING`, `TESTING`, `RELEASING` or `RFC_RECALIBRATION`; historical `PRD-*`, `DES-*` and `DEV-*` ids remain validator-compatible provenance.
- `next_task_sequence` preserves future `TASK-*` id allocation after done tasks are removed.
- Document, review, test, release and RFC tasks use `result_docs` for planned fact-source outputs; development tasks use `implementation_doc`.
- Checkpoint files, archive directories, gate result logs and lifecycle history are no longer active state facts.
- A SPRINTING task completes in two commits: implementation commit while the task is still present, then completion ledger commit after removing the task.
- Past task details are cold archive and only used for explicit forensic/audit/regression requests.
- `parallel_execution` is an optional top-level plan contract; when omitted the workflow remains serial. It does not store `phase` or `linked_task_id`; validators infer phase from lifecycle and task selection from `current_task_id`.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Any workflow phase task starts
-> plan.yaml contains one small TASK-* open task with phase metadata
-> agent edits only allowed_paths for the current slice or plan.draft output
-> result_docs or implementation_doc points to the produced fact source
-> docs index and generated overview are updated
-> validate-plan checks the open task contract during execution
-> phase exit validator runs only after open tasks are removed
```

```txt
SPRINTING task starts
-> plan.yaml contains full open task contract
-> agent edits only allowed_paths
-> required_gates pass
-> related module implementation doc records facts and verification
-> implementation commit is created while task remains in plan.yaml
-> task is removed from plan.yaml
-> completion ledger commit is created
-> both commits are pushed before the next task starts
```

Optional parallel execution:

```txt
User explicitly asks for parallel / multi-agent / multi-worktree
-> main agent creates parallel_execution.trigger = user_requested
-> runtime_managed: main agent spawns subagents when runtime supports it
-> user_orchestrated: main agent outputs worker prompts for manual Codex conversations/worktrees
-> workers operate inside owned_paths and run focused gates
-> main agent reviews, merges/cherry-picks, runs total gates and updates final fact sources
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- `plan.yaml` is intentionally short lived. It is not a historical task database.
- `current_phase` belongs only to `lifecycle.yaml`; `plan.yaml`, `plan.draft.yaml` and `parallel_execution` must not duplicate it.
- `plan.draft.yaml` is not active execution state and must not contain `current_task_id`.
- Field audit: `active_role`, `active_skill`, `current_milestone`, `blocked_reason`, `suspended_phase` and `allowed_next_phases` are lifecycle-only; `current_task_id` and `next_task_sequence` are plan-only; `tasks[].phase` is semantic task classification rather than current lifecycle state and remains on each task.
- Every phase task is task-controlled: one `TASK-*` task should produce one bounded document slice, review batch, test evidence set, release artifact set, RFC impact slice or development change.
- `validate-plan` permits open tasks and checks their shape; phase exit gates reject remaining open tasks.
- `allowed_paths`, `required_gates` and `working_notes` are execution-time constraints, not a long-term query API.
- Gate evidence belongs in the current task while executing, and in implementation docs, CI logs or release docs after completion.
- `lifecycle.yaml` does not store phase history. Phase history is reconstructed from git, PRs, CI or release evidence only when explicitly needed.
- `/dev` runs one task and stops. `/devloop` repeats `/dev` until no clear task remains or a blocker appears.
- The workflow assumes a singleton project-level Harness collaboration boundary; concurrent agents must coordinate through git and active state rather than independent archive files.
- Parallel execution is opt-in only. `trigger` must be `user_requested`, `mode` must be `runtime_managed` or `user_orchestrated`, and validators reject duplicate `phase` / `linked_task_id` fields in the contract.
- Workers do not own final fact sources. PRD, plan state, implementation docs, test results, generated overviews and total gate evidence are integrated by the main agent.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Early designs used checkpoint files, `.agent/archive/**`, `gate_results.log` and lifecycle `history`; those have been removed from the active state model.
- DEV-043 migrated state/task facts from task-grain implementation docs into this module-level protocol document.

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Do not reintroduce active historical ledgers unless a new RFC explicitly changes the state model.
- If a new workflow action needs durable history, prefer git/tag/release evidence or module implementation docs before adding state files.
