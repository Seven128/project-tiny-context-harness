## 2. 当前实现范围

- `.codex/state/lifecycle.yaml` stores the single source for current phase routing state.
- `.codex/state/plan.yaml` stores the current and future short-lived task contract across all workflow phases, without duplicating `current_phase`.
- `plan.yaml` is conceptually a recoverable task-splitting container for long-running project goals; the default Harness workflow only interprets phase-related tasks, while broader project-specific task definitions belong in local configuration or overlays.
- `.codex/state/plan.draft.yaml` is the current built-in draft queue; it stores only unadopted development draft tasks and `next_task_sequence`, without `current_phase` or `current_task_id`.
- `TASK-*` is the new task id model; `phase` identifies `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING`, `ARCHITECTING`, `SPRINTING`, `REVIEWING`, `TESTING`, `RELEASING` or `RFC_RECALIBRATION`; historical `PRD-*`, `DES-*` and `DEV-*` ids remain validator-compatible provenance.
- `next_task_sequence` preserves future `TASK-*` id allocation after done tasks are removed.
- Document, review, test, release and RFC tasks use `result_docs` for planned fact-source outputs; development tasks use `implementation_doc`.
- Checkpoint files, archive directories, gate result logs and lifecycle history are no longer active state facts.
- `.codex/state/memory.md` is a short cross-stage reminder and navigation surface; complete decision context, alternatives, rationale and consequences belong in `.docs/05_decisions/` ADRs or other formal `.docs/**` fact sources.
- `.docs/05_decisions/` is not a lifecycle phase; it is an `ARCHITECTING`-produced ADR fact source for durable architecture decisions that may outlive a single architecture or tech plan slice.
- `phase_contracts.yaml` uses a lightweight explicit directed graph: `phases` are stable phase contract nodes, and top-level `transitions` are legal directed edges with trigger, kind and minimal effects. Canonical phase nodes no longer use `next` / `returns`; `transition.py` keeps a legacy fallback only for older consumer policies that do not yet contain `transitions`.
- The phase graph is intentionally lightweight. It exists so transition helpers, validators and agents read the same legal flow contract; it does not store task history, operator logs, debug evidence, runbook bodies, implementation doc text or phase execution history, and it does not introduce graph engine classes, traversal frameworks or visualization.
- User migration cost is low for managed consumers: `sdlc-harness upgrade` or `sdlc-harness sync` refreshes the managed policy and transition helper, while existing `lifecycle.yaml`, `plan.yaml` and task data stay valid. Custom phase policies need a manual `next` / `returns` to top-level `transitions` conversion; old policies still work through the transition helper fallback, but canonical validation expects the explicit graph after sync.
- A SPRINTING task completes in two commits: implementation commit while the task is still present, then completion ledger commit after removing the task.
- Generic draft-to-plan rule: when any workflow promotes a draft into a formal `TASK-*`, it removes the source draft in the same state update; the current built-in implementation point is SPRINTING consuming `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]`.
- Past task details are cold archive and only used for explicit forensic/audit/regression requests.
- Release history is also cold archive. `.docs/08_release/CURRENT_RELEASE.md` stores only the current release status; older release evidence is reconstructed from git tags, registry metadata, CI, release commits or external release systems.
- `parallel_execution` is an on-demand top-level plan contract. Each stage task defaults to a parallel eligibility check; when omitted for a task, that task remains serial. It does not store `phase` or `linked_task_id`; validators infer phase from lifecycle and task selection from `current_task_id`.
- `resume_capsule` is an optional top-level plan recovery card that becomes required for high-risk runtime/live SPRINTING tasks (`external_provider_live`, `deployed_runtime`, `business_handoff_ready`, or target runtime `cloud_vm`, `managed_service`, `browser`, `worker`). It stores only current state, canonical path, next step, blocker, last passed gate, do-not-retry entries and recovery refs.
- `.docs/09_runbooks/**` stores runtime/live/remote-operator runbooks, evidence indexes and exploration appendices. `resume_capsule.recovery_refs` must include the current implementation doc and at least one runbook/evidence document.
- Open task `working_notes` remains a short recovery surface: target 5-8 notes, validator hard limit 8 notes.
- Direct `validate-dev` is the SPRINTING in-development gate. It allows a valid current open `phase: "SPRINTING"` task, checks scoped dirty files and draft consumption, and rejects missing current-task contracts.
- `Development Self-Test Report` now requires `Report Status: PASS | BLOCKED | IN_PROGRESS | STALE`; direct `validate-dev` only passes completion-oriented evidence when `Report Status: PASS` and every scenario is `PASS`.
- `self_test_contract` keeps `module_key_test_path` as the compatible short summary and can add `module_key_test_graph` as a lightweight DAG for complex/high-risk paths. `graph_required: true` makes the graph mandatory for that task; legacy text-only contracts still pass when graph is not required.
- The test graph is a handoff contract, not active execution state: it only stores path nodes, directed edges and short evidence pointers, while runbooks, evidence bodies, debug logs, operator logs and task history remain outside the graph.
- High-risk runtime/live implementation docs use a short `Current Operator Path` for canonical operator path, runbook link, credential reference name, command/UI channel and do-not-retry summary. Debug logs, operator logs, runbook bodies, exploration history and diagnostic attempts stay out of the self-test report.
- `validate-current` and `tools/run_current_gate.py` keep phase-exit safety: after the phase gate runs, `plan.yaml` must have no open tasks before lifecycle advancement.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `.codex/state/plan.yaml`, `.codex/state/plan.draft.yaml`, lifecycle phase transitions and `validate-plan` / direct `validate-dev` / phase-exit `validate-current` gates.
- Exit / side effects: validators accept or reject task contracts, draft consumption and phase-exit readiness; SPRINTING writes implementation and completion ledger commits.
- Config contract: task fields (`phase`, `allowed_paths`, `required_gates`, `result_docs`, `implementation_doc`) and lifecycle `current_phase`.
- Fixture/live boundary: workflow state protocol only; no product runtime is owned by plan state itself.

## Development Evidence

- Evidence Level: `local_runtime`, verified through package CLI regression and local Harness gates for TASK-084.
- Target Runtime Environment: `local`; the handoff entrypoint is `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc`.
- Runnable Entry: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc; npx sdlc-harness validate-plan; npx sdlc-harness validate-dev`.
- Observable Exit: package regression passed with validator coverage for `workflow_default`, `codex_native_subagents`, legacy `user_requested`, invalid provider cases and SPRINTING path-lock violations; source sync/check also passed.
- Client / Server Initialization: local Node CLI runtime starts through `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` and package CLI commands; no server process is required.
- Config Contract: no secrets; Harness root comes from `package.json#sdlcHarness.harnessFolderName` or `sdlc-harness.config.json#harnessFolderName`, and the parallel contract is read from `plan.yaml#parallel_execution`.
- Testing Handoff Readiness: ready for Review/Testing handoff after package tests, source sync/check, docs overview, validate-harness, validate-rfc and validate-dev pass.
- Known Missing Runtime Boundaries: no standalone `sdlc-harness parallel run` CLI is implemented in this task; Codex native subagents remain the runtime provider governed by prompt and plan contract.
- Basic Self-test Evidence: See `Development Self-Test Report`; `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` PASS for TASK-084 package regression and the lightweight phase graph regression.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Any workflow phase task starts
-> plan.yaml contains one small TASK-* open task with phase metadata
-> agent edits only allowed_paths for the current slice or plan.draft output
-> result_docs or implementation_doc points to the produced fact source
-> docs index and generated overview are updated
-> validate-plan checks the open task contract during execution
-> phase exit validator runs only after open tasks are removed
```

```txt
ARCHITECTING discovers PRD needs revision before development
-> transition.py reads phase_contracts.yaml#transitions edge ARCHITECTING -> REQUIREMENT_GATHERING
-> python3 tools/transition.py --to REQUIREMENT_GATHERING is legal without --force
-> lifecycle active_role/active_skill become pm/pjsdlc_pm_prd
-> PM updates PRD through one REQUIREMENT_GATHERING task and validate-pm
-> transition.py --to ARCHITECTING resumes design
```

```txt
Later-stage review/test/release discovers requirement or development self-test drift
-> python3 tools/transition.py --to RFC_RECALIBRATION is legal from SPRINTING / REVIEWING / TESTING / RELEASING because transitions declare those interrupt edges
-> lifecycle.suspended_phase records the interrupted phase through transition effects
-> active_role/active_skill become rfc_owner/pjsdlc_rfc_recalibrate
-> RFC work runs validate-rfc and creates or adjusts downstream SPRINTING tasks
-> transition.py --to SPRINTING follows the RFC resume edge, clears suspended_phase and resumes development
```

```txt
SPRINTING task starts
-> if no open task exists, agent may promote one plan.draft.yaml task into a formal TASK-* and delete the source draft
-> plan.yaml contains full open task contract
-> high-risk runtime/live tasks maintain resume_capsule and .docs/09_runbooks recovery refs
-> agent edits only allowed_paths
-> direct validate-dev may run while the current task remains open
-> required_gates pass
-> related module implementation doc records facts and verification
-> implementation commit is created while task remains in plan.yaml
-> task is removed from plan.yaml
-> completion ledger commit is created
-> validate-current can pass only after no open task remains
-> both commits are pushed before the next task starts
```

Default parallel execution:

```txt
Stage task starts
-> main agent performs parallel eligibility check
-> if safe, main agent creates parallel_execution.trigger = workflow_default
-> runtime_managed + codex_native_subagents is the default provider
-> user_requested keeps explicit user parallel intent
-> user_orchestrated / codex_exec_worktree are fallback providers
-> workers operate inside owned_paths and run focused gates
-> main agent reviews, merges/cherry-picks, runs total gates and updates final fact sources
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- `plan.yaml` is intentionally short lived. It is not a historical task database.
- `plan.yaml` is not an exhaustive log of everything an Agent does. The generic workflow contract covers tasks that affect phase deliverables, gates, implementation facts or RFC recalibration; local teams may extend task taxonomy for broader project management needs without changing the core `TASK-*` workflow semantics.
- `current_phase` belongs only to `lifecycle.yaml`; `plan.yaml`, `plan.draft.yaml` and `parallel_execution` must not duplicate it.
- `transition.py` derives legal targets from the explicit phase graph in `phase_contracts.yaml#transitions`. `allowed_next_phases` is regenerated from outgoing edges of the target phase; RFC interrupt/resume and BLOCKED interrupt/resume behavior come from edge effects instead of hardcoded transition rules. If an older consumer policy lacks `transitions`, the helper falls back to legacy `next` / `returns` plus the former RFC and BLOCKED rules for compatibility.
- `validate-harness` rejects canonical phase graph drift: missing top-level `transitions`, legacy `next` / `returns` on phase nodes, unknown phase references, duplicate edges, invalid transition kinds, invalid effects and illegal `<suspended_phase>` targets.
- Draft queues are not active execution state and must not retain adopted or completed drafts. The current built-in draft queue is `plan.draft.yaml`; it must not contain `current_task_id`.
- direct `validate-dev` rejects any remaining `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]`; agents must either continue promoting real unadopted drafts or remove already-consumed stale drafts before development completion.
- direct `validate-dev` requires lifecycle `current_phase: "SPRINTING"` and allows either an empty development queue or one valid current open `phase: "SPRINTING"` task with `current_task_id`, `docs`, `allowed_paths`, `required_gates`, `acceptance_criteria` and `implementation_doc`.
- direct `validate-dev` requires `resume_capsule` for high-risk current SPRINTING tasks, validates its task id, concrete recovery fields, do-not-retry list, current implementation doc ref and `.docs/09_runbooks/**` ref.
- direct `validate-dev` requires legal `Development Self-Test Report` status. `BLOCKED`, `IN_PROGRESS` and `STALE` reports are recoverable facts but cannot close a development task; `PASS` with any non-PASS scenario also fails.
- `validate-plan` and `validate-dev` validate `module_key_test_graph` when present or required: exactly one entry, at least one observable exit, allowed node kinds, unique ids, known edge refs, no cycles, all nodes reachable from entry, every scenario represented by a reachable scenario node, and every scenario path reaching an observable exit.
- direct `validate-dev` rejects self-test report headings that turn the report into a debug/operator/runbook/exploration log. High-risk tasks must link operator facts through `Current Operator Path` and `.docs/09_runbooks/**`.
- `validate-dev` enforces dirty-file scoping when a current open task exists; changes outside the current task `allowed_paths` fail the direct dev gate.
- ADRs solve the long-term "why this option, not another" problem. Architecture and tech plan slices may keep local rationale, but decisions with alternatives, cross-module or cross-stage impact, high reversal cost or future supersede semantics belong in `.docs/05_decisions/`.
- `memory.md` must not become a decision ledger. It may point to ADRs, PRDs, tech plans or implementation docs, but detailed context, alternatives, tradeoffs and consequences remain in those formal fact sources.
- Field audit: `active_role`, `active_skill`, `current_milestone`, `blocked_reason`, `suspended_phase` and `allowed_next_phases` are lifecycle-only; `current_task_id` and `next_task_sequence` are plan-only; `tasks[].phase` is semantic task classification rather than current lifecycle state and remains on each task.
- Every phase task is task-controlled: one `TASK-*` task should produce one bounded document slice, review batch, test evidence set, release artifact set, RFC impact slice or development change.
- `validate-plan` permits open tasks and checks their shape; phase exit gates reject remaining open tasks. In `SPRINTING`, this no-open rule lives in `validate-current` and `tools/run_current_gate.py`, not in direct `validate-dev`.
- `allowed_paths`, `required_gates` and `working_notes` are execution-time constraints, not a long-term query API; open task `working_notes` must stay within the 8 item recovery-note limit.
- Gate evidence belongs in the current task while executing, and in implementation docs, CI logs, current release status or external release systems after completion.
- `lifecycle.yaml` does not store phase history. Phase history is reconstructed from git, PRs, CI, registry metadata, tags or external release evidence only when explicitly needed.
- `/dev` runs one task and stops. `/devloop` repeats `/dev` until neither `plan.yaml.tasks[]` nor `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]` contains a clear next task, or a blocker appears.
- The workflow assumes a singleton project-level Harness collaboration boundary; concurrent agents must coordinate through git and active state rather than independent archive files.
- Parallel execution is default-evaluated and on-demand. `trigger` must be `workflow_default` or `user_requested`; `workflow_default` requires `runtime.provider: "codex_native_subagents"`; `mode` must be `runtime_managed` or `user_orchestrated`; validators reject duplicate `phase` / `linked_task_id` fields in the contract.
- SPRINTING write workers must declare non-empty, non-overlapping `owned_paths` within the current task `allowed_paths`; non-native write runtimes still require `branch` and `worktree`.
- Workers do not own final fact sources. PRD, plan state, implementation docs, test results, generated overviews and total gate evidence are integrated by the main agent.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Early designs used checkpoint files, `.agent/archive/**`, `gate_results.log` and lifecycle `history`; those have been removed from the active state model.
- DEV-043 migrated state/task facts from task-grain implementation docs into this module-level protocol document.

| 2026-05-28 | Spec clarification | Working tree | Clarified that `plan.yaml` is a general recoverable task-splitting container, while default Harness behavior only governs workflow phase tasks; broader task definitions are local configuration concerns. |
| 2026-05-28 | `TASK-062` | Working tree | Added promote-on-consume semantics for `plan.draft.yaml`, dev-state validation, package validator parity, and cleared the stale `DEV-001` draft from current state. |
| 2026-05-28 | `TASK-063` | Working tree | Clarified that promote-on-consume is the generic rule for any draft-to-plan workflow, while `plan.draft.yaml` remains the current built-in development draft queue. |
| 2026-05-28 | `TASK-065` | Pending implementation commit | Clarified ADR and memory responsibilities across PROJECT_SPEC, README/package README, architect skill, ADR template and package memory seeds. |
| 2026-05-29 | `TASK-069` | Working tree | Clarified that release history is cold archive while `.docs/08_release/CURRENT_RELEASE.md` remains the active release status fact source. |
| 2026-05-29 | `TASK-071` | Working tree | Split direct `validate-dev` open-task semantics from `validate-current` phase-exit no-open checks and moved managed Makefile dev gate to package CLI. |
| 2026-05-30 | `TASK-082` | Working tree | Constrained RFC interrupts to SPRINTING and later phases, preserved normal REVIEWING -> TESTING routing, and cleared `suspended_phase` when RFC returns to SPRINTING. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Do not reintroduce active historical ledgers unless a new RFC explicitly changes the state model.
- If a new workflow action needs durable history, prefer git, tags, registry/CI/release systems or module implementation docs before adding state files.
