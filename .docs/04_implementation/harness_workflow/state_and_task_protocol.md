## 2. 当前实现范围

- `.codex/state/lifecycle.yaml` stores the single source for current phase routing state.
- `.codex/state/plan.yaml` stores the current and future short-lived task contract across all workflow phases, without duplicating `current_phase`.
- `plan.yaml` is conceptually a recoverable task-splitting container for long-running project goals; the default Harness workflow only interprets phase-related tasks, while broader project-specific task definitions belong in local configuration or overlays.
- `.codex/state/plan.draft.yaml` is the current built-in draft queue; it stores only unadopted development draft tasks and `next_task_sequence`, without `current_phase` or `current_task_id`.
- `TASK-*` is the new task id model; `phase` identifies `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING`, `ARCHITECTING`, `SPRINTING`, `REVIEWING`, `TESTING`, `RELEASING` or `RFC_RECALIBRATION`; historical `PRD-*`, `DES-*` and `DEV-*` ids remain validator-compatible provenance.
- `next_task_sequence` preserves future `TASK-*` id allocation after done tasks are removed.
- Document, review, test, release and RFC tasks use `result_docs` for planned fact-source outputs; development tasks use `implementation_doc`.
- Checkpoint files, archive directories, gate result logs and lifecycle history are no longer active state facts.
- `.codex/state/memory.md` is a short cross-stage reminder and navigation surface; complete decision context, alternatives, rationale and consequences belong in `.docs/05_decisions/` ADRs or other formal `.docs/**` fact sources.
- `.docs/05_decisions/` is not a lifecycle phase; it is an `ARCHITECTING`-produced ADR fact source for durable architecture decisions that may outlive a single architecture or tech plan slice.
- `phase_contracts.yaml` supports optional `returns` targets for bounded pre-development rollback; the default contract allows `ARCHITECTING -> REQUIREMENT_GATHERING` so PRD facts can be corrected before `SPRINTING`.
- A SPRINTING task completes in two commits: implementation commit while the task is still present, then completion ledger commit after removing the task.
- Generic draft-to-plan rule: when any workflow promotes a draft into a formal `TASK-*`, it removes the source draft in the same state update; the current built-in implementation point is SPRINTING consuming `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]`.
- Past task details are cold archive and only used for explicit forensic/audit/regression requests.
- `parallel_execution` is an optional top-level plan contract; when omitted the workflow remains serial. It does not store `phase` or `linked_task_id`; validators infer phase from lifecycle and task selection from `current_task_id`.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `.codex/state/plan.yaml`, `.codex/state/plan.draft.yaml`, lifecycle phase transitions and `validate-plan` / `validate-dev` gates.
- Exit / side effects: validators accept or reject task contracts, draft consumption and phase-exit readiness; SPRINTING writes implementation and completion ledger commits.
- Config contract: task fields (`phase`, `allowed_paths`, `required_gates`, `result_docs`, `implementation_doc`) and lifecycle `current_phase`.
- Fixture/live boundary: workflow state protocol only; no product runtime is owned by plan state itself.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Any workflow phase task starts
-> plan.yaml contains one small TASK-* open task with phase metadata
-> agent edits only allowed_paths for the current slice or plan.draft output
-> result_docs or implementation_doc points to the produced fact source
-> docs index and generated overview are updated
-> validate-plan checks the open task contract during execution
-> phase exit validator runs only after open tasks are removed
```

```txt
ARCHITECTING discovers PRD needs revision before development
-> transition.py reads phase_contracts.yaml#phases.ARCHITECTING.returns
-> python3 tools/transition.py --to REQUIREMENT_GATHERING is legal without --force
-> lifecycle active_role/active_skill become pm/pjsdlc_pm_prd
-> PM updates PRD through one REQUIREMENT_GATHERING task and validate-pm
-> transition.py --to ARCHITECTING resumes design
```

```txt
SPRINTING task starts
-> if no open task exists, agent may promote one plan.draft.yaml task into a formal TASK-* and delete the source draft
-> plan.yaml contains full open task contract
-> agent edits only allowed_paths
-> required_gates pass
-> related module implementation doc records facts and verification
-> implementation commit is created while task remains in plan.yaml
-> task is removed from plan.yaml
-> completion ledger commit is created
-> both commits are pushed before the next task starts
```

Optional parallel execution:

```txt
User explicitly asks for parallel / multi-agent / multi-worktree
-> main agent creates parallel_execution.trigger = user_requested
-> runtime_managed: main agent spawns subagents when runtime supports it
-> user_orchestrated: main agent outputs worker prompts for manual Codex conversations/worktrees
-> workers operate inside owned_paths and run focused gates
-> main agent reviews, merges/cherry-picks, runs total gates and updates final fact sources
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- `plan.yaml` is intentionally short lived. It is not a historical task database.
- `plan.yaml` is not an exhaustive log of everything an Agent does. The generic workflow contract covers tasks that affect phase deliverables, gates, implementation facts or RFC recalibration; local teams may extend task taxonomy for broader project management needs without changing the core `TASK-*` workflow semantics.
- `current_phase` belongs only to `lifecycle.yaml`; `plan.yaml`, `plan.draft.yaml` and `parallel_execution` must not duplicate it.
- `transition.py` derives legal targets from the current phase's `next`, optional `returns`, `allowed_next_phases`, RFC/BLOCKED special routes and BLOCKED resume rules. After transition, `allowed_next_phases` is regenerated from the target phase's `next` plus `returns`.
- Draft queues are not active execution state and must not retain adopted or completed drafts. The current built-in draft queue is `plan.draft.yaml`; it must not contain `current_task_id`.
- `validate-dev` rejects any remaining `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]`; agents must either continue promoting real unadopted drafts or remove already-consumed stale drafts before development completion.
- ADRs solve the long-term "why this option, not another" problem. Architecture and tech plan slices may keep local rationale, but decisions with alternatives, cross-module or cross-stage impact, high reversal cost or future supersede semantics belong in `.docs/05_decisions/`.
- `memory.md` must not become a decision ledger. It may point to ADRs, PRDs, tech plans or implementation docs, but detailed context, alternatives, tradeoffs and consequences remain in those formal fact sources.
- Field audit: `active_role`, `active_skill`, `current_milestone`, `blocked_reason`, `suspended_phase` and `allowed_next_phases` are lifecycle-only; `current_task_id` and `next_task_sequence` are plan-only; `tasks[].phase` is semantic task classification rather than current lifecycle state and remains on each task.
- Every phase task is task-controlled: one `TASK-*` task should produce one bounded document slice, review batch, test evidence set, release artifact set, RFC impact slice or development change.
- `validate-plan` permits open tasks and checks their shape; phase exit gates reject remaining open tasks.
- `allowed_paths`, `required_gates` and `working_notes` are execution-time constraints, not a long-term query API.
- Gate evidence belongs in the current task while executing, and in implementation docs, CI logs or release docs after completion.
- `lifecycle.yaml` does not store phase history. Phase history is reconstructed from git, PRs, CI or release evidence only when explicitly needed.
- `/dev` runs one task and stops. `/devloop` repeats `/dev` until neither `plan.yaml.tasks[]` nor `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]` contains a clear next task, or a blocker appears.
- The workflow assumes a singleton project-level Harness collaboration boundary; concurrent agents must coordinate through git and active state rather than independent archive files.
- Parallel execution is opt-in only. `trigger` must be `user_requested`, `mode` must be `runtime_managed` or `user_orchestrated`, and validators reject duplicate `phase` / `linked_task_id` fields in the contract.
- Workers do not own final fact sources. PRD, plan state, implementation docs, test results, generated overviews and total gate evidence are integrated by the main agent.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Early designs used checkpoint files, `.agent/archive/**`, `gate_results.log` and lifecycle `history`; those have been removed from the active state model.
- DEV-043 migrated state/task facts from task-grain implementation docs into this module-level protocol document.

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Do not reintroduce active historical ledgers unless a new RFC explicitly changes the state model.
- If a new workflow action needs durable history, prefer git/tag/release evidence or module implementation docs before adding state files.
