## 2. 当前实现范围

- Workflow roles are represented as local Skills under `<harnessRoot>/skills/pjsdlc_*/SKILL.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` provides the deterministic soft index from lifecycle state to `active_skill`.
- Native Agent skill hydration, when supported by the client, is a separate hard-index mechanism based on the client-specific skill root.
- Natural language intent and `/xxx` macro aliases map to the same workflow actions.
- Project-local role prompt additions live under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/<skill_name>.md` and are appended to managed Skill output by `sdlc-harness sync`.
- Override files support plain snippets and complete `SKILL.md` extensions with `name`/`description` frontmatter; complete extensions merge their `description` into final Skill metadata and append their body after stripping override frontmatter.
- The generated `Local Override` block tells maintainers and downstream agents to check the merged Skill for semantic conflicts between package base rules and project-local override rules.
- This authoring repository keeps a private authoring Skill under `.codex/skills/authoring/**`; package source sync excludes it from user projects.
- The authoring Skill requires README/package README coverage to stay aligned with all public package capabilities.
- PM, Architect, Manager, Dev, Reviewer, Tester, Release and RFC prompts now describe default parallel eligibility checks, Codex native subagent scheduling, fallback modes and final fact-source integration with the main agent.
- PM and Architect prompts require deleting the superseded monolithic PRD/product or tech plan file after user-requested slicing creates replacement slices and updates the related fact-source references.
- `UI_UX_DESIGNING` is now a first-class lifecycle phase between `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING` and `ARCHITECTING`. It uses `pjsdlc_uiux_design`, writes `.docs/02_experience/**`, optionally writes root `DESIGN.md`, and exits through `validate-uiux`.
- `.docs/02_experience/**` records UX flow, screen contracts, interaction states, responsive/a11y acceptance and handoff matrix. visual UI projects also use Google-format `DESIGN.md` as a design-system fact source; CLI/API/non-visual projects declare `Applicability: cli_or_api_experience` or `Applicability: not_applicable`.
- Architect prompt now treats semantic design slicing as a `make validate-design` hard gate: `plan.draft.yaml` development tasks must reference `docs.tech_plan`, multiple draft tasks need distinct primary tech plan slices, generated `overview.md` cannot satisfy design deliverables, and explicit cross-cutting themes require dedicated architecture slices.
- Architect prompt now consumes `.docs/02_experience/**` and `DESIGN.md`, requires `Experience Input Review`, and makes UI/frontend draft tasks reference `docs.uiux` plus `docs.design_system`.
- Manager, PM and Architect prompts now describe the development-before rollback path from `ARCHITECTING` to `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING` for PRD edits, while preserving RFC workflow for changes after `SPRINTING`.
- Manager prompt routes `/uiux` and natural-language UI/UX requests to `UI_UX_DESIGNING`. It also supports `ARCHITECTING -> UI_UX_DESIGNING` pre-sprint return and TESTING `bugfix_uiux_replan`.
- PM, Architect, Reviewer, Tester, Release and RFC prompts now require each main workflow action to run as one small `TASK-*` `plan.yaml` task with `phase` metadata. This covers conversational generation, existing-document slicing, synthesis from prior fact sources, review batches, test evidence, release preparation and RFC recalibration.
- Dev, Review, Tester and Implementation Doc prompts now treat runnable entry/exit as a hard phase boundary: SPRINTING must implement or block promised API/CLI/adapter/provider/config/fixture-live boundaries, REVIEWING must block missing entry/exit, and TESTING may only exercise existing entrypoints.
- Dev, Review, Tester, RFC and Implementation Doc prompts now consume UI/UX facts for UI/frontend work: SPRINTING implements screen states, interactions, responsive behavior, focus/keyboard/touch and design tokens; REVIEWING checks UX/design conformance; TESTING derives UI cases from screen contracts and handoff matrix; RFC impact analysis checks `.docs/02_experience/**` and `DESIGN.md`.
- Review, test and implementation templates include runnable entry/exit sections. `validate-review` and `validate-test` require entry/exit evidence text, and TESTING validators reject runtime, bootstrap, provider, deploy or package runtime script changes.
- TESTING distinguishes `.docs/07_test/TEST_STRATEGY.md`, `.docs/07_test/TEST_CASES.md` and `.docs/07_test/TEST_REPORT.md`; `TEST_REPORT.md` is execution-only evidence and `validate-test` no longer falls back to `TEST_PLAN.md`.
- `TEST_CASES.md` now has a lightweight case contract: stable `TC-*` IDs, requirement/risk refs, runnable entry, preconditions, steps, expected exit, type, priority and short evidence pointer. `validate-test` keeps legacy report-only compatibility, but validates case structure when a report references `TC-*`, a TESTING task plans `TEST_CASES.md`, or the file exists.
- Tester and Manager prompts now classify TESTING bugfix recovery with `Bugfix Route`: `bugfix_replan` returns to `ARCHITECTING` for tech plan / contract / graph changes, `bugfix_implementation_gap` returns to `SPRINTING` for implementation deviations, and requirement or acceptance changes still use RFC.
- RFC recalibration now records `Test Fact Source Impact` and removes superseded `.docs/07_test/**` files from current test facts and `.docs/INDEX.md` when a route, entry/exit or acceptance boundary changes.
- `validate-dev` now requires implementation docs to include `Runnable Entry/Exit` facts or explicit `Not applicable`, so missing runtime boundaries cannot be deferred into TESTING by omission.
- `validate-dev` now requires the current open SPRINTING task implementation doc to include structured `Development Evidence`: `Runnable Entry`, `Observable Exit`, `Basic Self-test Evidence`, or a justified `Not applicable`.
- `validate-dev` now treats service / agent / runtime readiness as stronger than provider or fixture smoke: current task evidence must include `Client / Server Initialization` and `Config Contract`, and provider smoke, fixture smoke, fake adapter or one-shot smoke cannot alone satisfy application readiness.
- `validate-dev` now promotes runtime readiness into the task contract: runtime/app/provider/live SPRINTING tasks declare `evidence_level.required` and `target_runtime_environment`, `deployed_runtime` cannot be closed by lower-level smoke, and `business_handoff_ready` requires a Testing Handoff Contract.
- `validate-design` and `validate-dev` now enforce `self_test_contract`: design binds runnable-boundary tasks to a tech plan `Development Self-Test Contract`, and development requires a completed implementation doc `Development Self-Test Report` before handoff.
- Development Self-Test Contract / Report now require `module_key_test_path` / `Module Key Test Path`, recording the module key test path from local start or invocation to all self-test scenarios completion. The path is scoped to the current task/module and covers promised runnable entries, internal key paths, boundaries, checkpoints and observable completion evidence for later debug reuse.
- Complex Development Self-Test Contract can now add lightweight `module_key_test_graph` DAG detail with `graph_required: true`. Architect/RFC define the skeleton; Dev and Implementation Doc prompts record the actual graph; Reviewer and Tester consume it for entry/checkpoint/scenario/exit/evidence refs without turning TESTING into runtime construction.
- Dev and Implementation Doc prompts now treat `Development Self-Test Report` as a development deliverable, separate from code/config/test implementation artifacts. When `self_test_contract.status: "required"`, agents must execute the current scenarios and required gates before writing the report; historical reports, template fields, code reading or unrelated green gates cannot stand in for current-run evidence.
- Development Self-Test Report now has an explicit handoff-card boundary: it must include `Report Status: PASS | BLOCKED | IN_PROGRESS | STALE`, `Module Application Entry`, `Module Key Test Path`, scenario results, executed gates, `Observable Exit`, `Current Blocker`, `Testing Handoff Readiness` and `Evidence Index Refs`; it proves only module entry/core path/exit/minimal evidence pointers and must not become a debug log, operator log, runbook, evidence dump or exploration history.
- The authoring-only Harness design prompt now states the lightweight-constraint principle: workflow changes should first align Agent attention with the `PROJECT_SPEC.md` purpose, and heavier validation or execution mechanisms are reserved for heavy logic when issues repeat, risk is high, or machine proof is required.
- The authoring-only Harness design prompt now constrains graph/data-structure workflow changes: phase graph, task graph and similar schemas must stay lightweight and declarative, name their source of truth, consumer, validator and compatibility path, avoid execution history/evidence/runbook content, and require PRD/RFC approval before introducing heavy graph engines, node/edge classes, traversal frameworks or visualizers.
- The authoring-only Harness design prompt now applies the same lightweight boundary to test path graphs: graph nodes and edges only hold handoff path skeleton and evidence pointers, not execution trace, debug output, operator log, runbook body or evidence body.
- The authoring-only Harness design prompt now asks maintainers to consider data structures for workflow changes when repeated consumers, validator/tool usage or recovery reliability would benefit, while explicitly weighing migration cost, compatibility, schema drift, context weight and over-abstraction before promoting prose into structure.
- The authoring-only Harness design prompt now states the PROJECT_SPEC boundary: it describes stable zero-to-one project design, product/protocol rationale and canonical behavior, while version migration and upgrade instructions belong in README / package README or release/implementation docs.
- The authoring-only Harness design prompt now requires future workflow changes to consult `memory.md#Harness Design Decisions` and related `.docs/05_decisions/ADR_*.md` before changing existing design tradeoffs, and to add new durable rationale as ADR slices instead of expanding `PROJECT_SPEC.md`.
- `validate-rfc` now requires `Development Self-Test Impact` for new RFCs that change entry/exit, runtime, gates, handoff or blocker semantics.
- `validate-uiux` requires a non-overview `.docs/02_experience/**` deliverable, PRD / requirement references unless `Applicability: not_applicable`, applicable screen states, responsive expectations and a11y/focus/keyboard/touch expectations. visual UI slices require root `DESIGN.md` and run the local `@google/design.md` linter, failing on errors.
- `validate-design` now rejects UI/frontend draft tasks that omit `docs.uiux` or `docs.design_system`, or reference missing UX slices / missing `DESIGN.md`.
- `validate-rfc` now requires `UI/UX Impact` for new RFCs that mention UI/UX, frontend, screen, interaction, browser/page or `DESIGN.md` changes.
- `validate-review` now requires explicit PASS/BLOCKED readiness fields for `Runnable Entry`, `Observable Exit`, `Initialization`, `Config Contract` and `Testing Handoff Readiness`; any `BLOCKED` field blocks TESTING handoff.
- `validate-review` and `validate-test` now reject `PASS` reports that acknowledge runtime/handoff mismatch, missing deployment, missing initialization, local-only evidence or fake adapters.
- `validate-test` now rejects `PASS` reports that acknowledge missing runnable entry/exit or missing `Development Evidence`; TESTING must report `BLOCKED` with recovery conditions instead.
- Dev and Manager prompts now distinguish direct SPRINTING `validate-dev` from phase-exit `validate-current`: direct dev gate allows a valid current open task, while phase advancement still requires no open tasks.
- RELEASING uses `.docs/08_release/CURRENT_RELEASE.md` as the canonical current release status. `validate-release` keeps accepting legacy versioned release docs when the current file is absent, but new release work updates the current status file instead of creating a version ledger.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: workflow Skills under `<harnessRoot>/skills/**`, managed templates/policies, Python validators, package `validate-*` commands and package source sync.
- Exit / side effects: updated prompts and validators govern phase behavior; `package sync-source` materializes distributable assets.
- Config contract: `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/**`, `packages/sdlc-harness/source-mappings.yaml`, `.docs/07_test/TEST_REPORT.md`.
- Fixture/live boundary: workflow contract only; TESTING may add fixtures/mocks/assertions/smoke runners under `tests/**` but cannot introduce product runtime/provider/bootstrap/deploy code.

## Development Evidence

- Runnable Entry: CLI command `npx sdlc-harness validate-dev` / `make validate-dev` validates the current SPRINTING task evidence contract through `packages/sdlc-harness/src/lib/validators.ts`.
- Observable Exit: Validator output reports PASS or concrete errors for missing `Development Evidence`, missing `Observable Exit`, missing `Client / Server Initialization`, missing `Config Contract`, missing `Basic Self-test Evidence`, missing `Module Key Test Path`, invalid `Module Key Test Graph`, missing `Evidence Index Refs`, overlong self-test reports, insufficient lower-level smoke, UI evidence gaps, or callable invocation/result gaps.
- Evidence Level: current task contract requires `local_runtime`; validator source and package CLI execute as local runtime checks.
- Target Runtime Environment: current task contract uses `local` with `npx sdlc-harness validate-dev` as the handoff entrypoint.
- Client / Server Initialization: service / agent / runtime tasks must record startup, live entrypoint, health/status, endpoint, CLI command or worker command evidence.
- Config Contract: service / agent / runtime tasks must record required env/config/API key inputs or an explicit no-config contract.
- Testing Handoff Readiness: package validator errors identify whether a task is ready for Review/Testing handoff or must remain in SPRINTING/RFC.
- Known Missing Runtime Boundaries: none for the Harness validator module; product runtimes in consumer projects are represented by task contracts rather than owned by this repository runtime.
- Basic Self-test Evidence: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` covers validator regression for TASK-079 after completion; final source sync and Harness gates are recorded in Test Coverage.
- Not applicable: not applicable only when a module has no product runtime boundary; this workflow validator module has CLI validator entrypoints, so structured evidence is required.

## Testing Handoff Contract

- Entry: `npx sdlc-harness validate-dev` or `make validate-dev`.
- Config: no secrets; harness root comes from `package.json#sdlcHarness.harnessFolderName` or `sdlc-harness.config.json#harnessFolderName`.
- Initialization / health: package CLI starts through Node and reads lifecycle/plan/implementation docs.
- Input sample: a SPRINTING task with `evidence_level.required`, `target_runtime_environment`, implementation doc and Development Evidence.
- Expected exit / observable side effect: PASS output or concrete validator errors for evidence level, target runtime, handoff entrypoint or Testing Handoff Contract mismatch.
- Cleanup / reset / idempotency: validator is read-only; repeated runs are idempotent.
- Evidence Level: `local_runtime`.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Agent starts work
-> read .codex/state/lifecycle.yaml
-> read active_skill unless user requested another workflow action
-> use corresponding local Skill prompt through AGENTS.md soft index
-> map natural language or /xxx alias to workflow action
-> execute phase/task protocol
```

Native Agent skill hydration, when available:

```txt
Client scans its configured skill root
-> semantic matcher selects a SKILL.md before the turn
-> selected Skill instructions hydrate the prompt
```

Harness supports this second path by placing workflow Skills under the configured `<harnessRoot>/skills` tree, but the deterministic lifecycle route does not depend on first-turn native hydration.

Skill sync with project-local role prompt additions:

```txt
Package asset packages/sdlc-harness/assets/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
+ optional <harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/<skill_name>.md
-> sdlc-harness sync
-> <harnessRoot>/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- Hard index means the Agent client itself knows a fixed skill root and can enumerate `SKILL.md` files before the model turn.
- Soft index means project instructions tell the model where to look after reading state, such as `active_skill` in `lifecycle.yaml`.
- Workflow reliability comes from the soft index because it is deterministic and tied to lifecycle state.
- User convenience comes from natural-language routing and macro aliases; users do not need to memorize every `/xxx`.
- `/plan` and `/goal` are client modes and are not automatically controlled by Harness.
- `UI_UX_DESIGNING` is a separate stage rather than an architecture subsection so downstream stages can consume stable screen contracts, interaction states, responsive/a11y expectations and visual tokens before technical task breakdown.
- `DESIGN.md` is only mandatory for visual UI. The validator accepts explicit non-visual applicability in `.docs/02_experience/**` to keep CLI/API/operator experience projects from manufacturing empty design systems.
- `@google/design.md` is a package dependency. Source Python and package TypeScript validators call the local linter path instead of relying on network `npx` package fetch during gates.
- Authoring-only prompts help this repository improve the Harness itself and should not be shipped into user projects by default.
- Package-facing behavior changes must keep both `README.md` and `packages/sdlc-harness/README.md` aligned with the full public capability list, not only `PROJECT_SPEC.md` or release status notes.
- Local Skill overrides are append-only in v1. They let projects add role preferences or complete local Skill extensions without replacing lifecycle, task, gate or allowed-path rules from the package Skill.
- `sync` auto-detects a complete Skill override when the override file starts with `name` and `description` frontmatter, validates that `name` matches the target skill, merges the override `description` into the final top-level metadata and appends the stripped body.
- `sync` writes a semantic maintenance note into each generated `Local Override` block so future agents can review phase boundaries, `allowed_paths`, `required_gates`, commit/release rules and completion checks for conflicts.
- `sync` blocks unknown files under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/*.md`, so a misspelled Skill name cannot silently fail to apply.
- `pjsdlc_managed/override_skills` keeps override configuration with other managed workflow configuration while preserving `<harnessRoot>/skills/**` as the shallow hard file index.
- When a user explicitly asks to slice an existing complete PRD/product document or complete tech plan into multiple slices, `pjsdlc_pm_prd` and `pjsdlc_architect_design` now require validating replacement slice coverage, updating `.docs/INDEX.md` and generated `overview.md`, synchronizing `plan.draft.yaml` references for tech plan slicing, and then deleting the superseded complete file so the facts are not duplicated.
- `pjsdlc_architect_design` now states that `make validate-design` hard-checks draft task `docs.tech_plan`, distinct primary tech plan slices, generated overview exclusion and dedicated architecture slices for explicit cross-cutting themes.
- `pjsdlc_manager`, `pjsdlc_pm_prd` and `pjsdlc_architect_design` share the same routing rule: PRD changes discovered in `ARCHITECTING` can return to `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING`; PRD changes discovered in `SPRINTING` or later use RFC recalibration.
- `pjsdlc_pm_prd`, `pjsdlc_architect_design`, `pjsdlc_reviewer`, `pjsdlc_tester`, `pjsdlc_release_manager` and `pjsdlc_rfc_recalibrate` create or resume one small `TASK-*` task before writing phase outputs. `pjsdlc_manager` routes `/prd`, `/design`, `/review`, `/test`, `/release` and `/rfc` through those task protocols and treats remaining open tasks as phase-exit blockers.
- SPRINTING Definition of Done now includes runnable entry/exit for promised API, CLI, server route, adapter, worker, provider, config contract and fixture/live boundaries. Missing entry/exit remains a dev/RFC blocker instead of becoming testing work.
- REVIEWING validates entry/exit readiness before TESTING. TESTING validates through existing entrypoints only and blocks product runtime, package runtime script, long-running runtime, systemd, cloud bootstrap, provider adapter and deploy/script changes.
- `validate-test` requires `.docs/07_test/TEST_REPORT.md`, rejects placeholder report text, and requires test matrix, regression evidence, coverage gaps, runnable entry/exit coverage and PASS/BLOCKED decision text.
- `validate-test` lightly validates `.docs/07_test/TEST_CASES.md` only when case facts are in scope: report `TC-*` refs, current TESTING task `result_docs`, or an existing cases file. It checks unique `TC-*`, required case fields and report refs without proving execution.
- `validate-plan` rejects non-`TESTING`/`RFC_RECALIBRATION` tasks that target `.docs/07_test/**`, so SPRINTING cannot create formal test facts before entry/exit delivery.
- `validate-rfc` checks `Test Fact Source Impact` and rejects RFCs that list superseded `.docs/07_test/**` paths still present in current facts or `.docs/INDEX.md`.
- TESTING boundary checks still reject `tests/runtime/**` and runtime-like test files, but allow clearly test-only fixture, mock, assertion and smoke files under `tests/**`.
- `validate-dev` checks implementation docs for runnable entry/exit facts, accepting explicit `Not applicable` only when the module truly has no product runtime boundary.
- `validate-dev` checks the current open SPRINTING task implementation doc for a `Development Evidence` section with concrete `Runnable Entry`, `Observable Exit`, `Client / Server Initialization`, `Config Contract` and `Basic Self-test Evidence`, or a justified `Not applicable`.
- `validate-design` checks runnable-boundary draft tasks for `self_test_contract` and verifies the referenced tech plan slice contains a `Development Self-Test Contract`.
- `validate-dev` checks `self_test_contract.required_gates` against task `required_gates`, requires `Report Status: PASS` and every contract scenario to have a `PASS` result in `Development Self-Test Report`, requires self-test report handoff fields and `Evidence Index Refs`, rejects `Actual Evidence` body fields, and rejects `BLOCKED`, `IN_PROGRESS` or `STALE` reports as unfinished development handoff.
- `validate-design` and `validate-dev` require `module_key_test_path` / `Module Key Test Path` so the implementation doc records the local-start-to-self-test-completion module key test path, including current task/module runnable entries, internal key paths, boundaries, checkpoints and completion evidence for future debug.
- `validate-plan` / package validators now validate optional `module_key_test_graph` when present or when `graph_required: true`: one entry, allowed node kinds, unique node ids, known edge refs, no cycles, scenario nodes reachable from entry, scenario nodes reaching observable exits, and short `evidence_ref` pointers only.
- High-risk runtime/live/remote-operator tasks now use resume-first recovery: Architect reserves `.docs/09_runbooks/**`, Dev maintains `plan.yaml#resume_capsule`, strategy-changing decisions are promoted to `resume_capsule.do_not_retry` / runbook `Hard Constraints`, Implementation Doc keeps operation logs and evidence dumps out of the main implementation facts, and Review/Testing consume the capsule/runbook before reading exploration appendices.
- `validate-dev` requires high-risk current SPRINTING tasks to have concrete `resume_capsule` fields, current implementation doc recovery ref, `.docs/09_runbooks/**` recovery ref, a short `Current Operator Path` with `Hard Constraints`, `Evidence Index Refs` under `.docs/09_runbooks/**`, and a `Gate Breakdown` in `Development Self-Test Report`; it also scans notes/docs/runbooks for session / QR / canonical path / do-not-retry judgments and fails when those judgments are not promoted.
- Open task `working_notes` now stays resume-first with a validator limit of 8 entries.
- `pjsdlc_dev_sprint` explicitly frames SPRINTING outputs as implementation artifacts plus development self-test artifacts. It requires scenario/gate execution before report writing, and blocks task completion when current-run runnable entry, internal key path and observable exit/evidence cannot be named.
- `pjsdlc_implementation_doc` records the same evidence provenance rule for module docs: `Development Self-Test Report` facts must come from the current task run, not from historical PASS text, template placeholders, code inspection or unrelated generic gates.
- `harness_package_design` distinguishes Agent execution violations from Harness contract gaps and prefers lightweight prompt/checklist/template/content constraints before adding heavier validators, scripts or executors.
- `harness_package_design` now requires future workflow graph/data-structure changes to preserve a lightweight declarative boundary, document consumer and validator paths, remove or explicitly deprecate duplicate facts, and avoid storing task history, operator logs, debug evidence, runbook bodies or implementation text in graph nodes or edges.
- `harness_package_design` now adds a general structure-vs-prose calibration rule: use data structures when they create stable, validator-consumed attention surfaces; keep prose/checklists when the information is one-off, human-context-heavy or lacks a clear consumer.
- `harness_package_design` now uses ADR slices as the durable design-rationale source: `PROJECT_SPEC.md` keeps summary links, `memory.md` keeps a short decision index, and ADR splits must preserve source trace.
- `validate-rfc` requires `Development Self-Test Impact` in RFC files from `RFC_023` onward when they mention entry/exit, runtime, target environment, gates, handoff or blockers.
- `validate-dev` rejects service / agent / runtime tasks whose evidence only proves provider smoke, fixture smoke, fake adapter or one-shot smoke without application readiness or `BLOCKED`.
- `validate-review` checks structured readiness fields and treats any `BLOCKED` field as a gate blocker.
- `validate-test` rejects `PASS` reports that still describe missing entry/exit or missing Development Evidence.
- Page evidence must include a dev server/page URL plus browser, Playwright, screenshot or equivalent interaction evidence; API/CLI/worker/RPA evidence must include an invocation command/endpoint and observable output, response, side effect, log, artifact or PASS/BLOCKED result.
- direct `validate-dev` is explicitly an in-development SPRINTING gate. It validates the current open task contract, dirty-file scope, draft consumption and implementation docs without forcing task removal. `validate-current` / `/advance` keeps no-open phase-exit behavior before REVIEWING.
- Managed Makefile `validate-dev` runs `$(SDLC_HARNESS) validate-dev`, then project `lint` and `test-current-domain`, so installed package consumers no longer need source-repo-only Python validators for this gate.
- Package Skill overrides remain append-only local extensions. The generated override block now states that package-managed phase boundaries remain authoritative and overrides may narrow local behavior but must not expand TESTING or REVIEWING into implementation/runtime ownership.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Earlier wording treated all workflow role files as native Skills. The current model distinguishes native hard-index hydration from Harness soft-index routing.
- The default authoring root moved from `.agent` to `.codex` after target-agent selection was added.
- DEV-043 consolidated legacy task records for role prompts, skill layout and natural-language control into this module-level doc.

| 2026-05-30 | Self-test report boundary hardening | Working tree | Added Report Status semantics, Current Operator Path prompt rules, log-section boundary and working_notes limit guidance. |
| 2026-05-31 | Lightweight explicit phase graph | Working tree | Added authoring guardrails for future workflow graph/data-structure changes: lightweight schema first, explicit consumer/validator/compatibility path and no evidence/history/runbook bodies inside graph nodes. |
| 2026-05-31 | Data-structure calibration | Working tree | Added authoring guidance to consider structured contracts for repeated workflow consumers while weighing migration, compatibility, context and over-abstraction costs. |

| 2026-05-31 | ADR-backed design rationale | Working tree | Required future workflow changes to consult memory / ADR design decision indexes and to add durable rationale as ADR slices instead of expanding `PROJECT_SPEC.md`. |
| 2026-06-01 | TESTING bugfix return boundary | Working tree | Added prompt routing for `Bugfix Route`, keeping bugfix recovery lightweight through existing return edges and avoiding a separate bugfix workflow engine. |
| 2026-06-01 | TESTING case contract | Working tree | Added lightweight `TEST_CASES.md` case schema and conditional `validate-test` checks for `TC-*` references, preserving report-only compatibility for legacy tasks. |

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- When adding a workflow role, update both the Skill file and the soft-index contract in lifecycle/phase policies.
- If a client-specific native skill root is supported, document it as hard-index behavior without assuming every Agent hydrates it identically.
- Do not document direct edits to `<harnessRoot>/skills/**/SKILL.md` as a customization path; use `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/*.md` and `sdlc-harness sync`.
