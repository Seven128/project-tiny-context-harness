## 2. 当前实现范围

- Workflow roles are represented as local Skills under `<harnessRoot>/skills/pjsdlc_*/SKILL.md`.
- `AGENTS.md` provides the deterministic soft index from lifecycle state to `active_skill`.
- Native Agent skill hydration, when supported by the client, is a separate hard-index mechanism based on the client-specific skill root.
- Natural language intent and `/xxx` macro aliases map to the same workflow actions.
- Project-local role prompt additions live under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/<skill_name>.md` and are appended to managed Skill output by `sdlc-harness sync`.
- Override files support plain snippets and complete `SKILL.md` extensions with `name`/`description` frontmatter; complete extensions merge their `description` into final Skill metadata and append their body after stripping override frontmatter.
- The generated `Local Override` block tells maintainers and downstream agents to check the merged Skill for semantic conflicts between package base rules and project-local override rules.
- This authoring repository keeps a private authoring Skill under `.codex/skills/authoring/**`; package source sync excludes it from user projects.
- The authoring Skill requires README/package README coverage to stay aligned with all public package capabilities.
- PM, Manager, Dev and Tester prompts now describe optional parallel execution semantics and keep final fact-source integration with the main agent.
- PM and Architect prompts require deleting the superseded monolithic PRD/product or tech plan file after user-requested slicing creates replacement slices and updates the related fact-source references.
- PM, Architect, Reviewer, Tester, Release and RFC prompts now require each main workflow action to run as one small `TASK-*` `plan.yaml` task with `phase` metadata. This covers conversational generation, existing-document slicing, synthesis from prior fact sources, review batches, test evidence, release preparation and RFC recalibration.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Agent starts work
-> read .codex/state/lifecycle.yaml
-> read active_skill unless user requested another workflow action
-> use corresponding local Skill prompt through AGENTS.md soft index
-> map natural language or /xxx alias to workflow action
-> execute phase/task protocol
```

Native Agent skill hydration, when available:

```txt
Client scans its configured skill root
-> semantic matcher selects a SKILL.md before the turn
-> selected Skill instructions hydrate the prompt
```

Harness supports this second path by placing workflow Skills under the configured `<harnessRoot>/skills` tree, but the deterministic lifecycle route does not depend on first-turn native hydration.

Skill sync with project-local role prompt additions:

```txt
Package asset packages/sdlc-harness/assets/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
+ optional <harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/<skill_name>.md
-> sdlc-harness sync
-> <harnessRoot>/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- Hard index means the Agent client itself knows a fixed skill root and can enumerate `SKILL.md` files before the model turn.
- Soft index means project instructions tell the model where to look after reading state, such as `active_skill` in `lifecycle.yaml`.
- Workflow reliability comes from the soft index because it is deterministic and tied to lifecycle state.
- User convenience comes from natural-language routing and macro aliases; users do not need to memorize every `/xxx`.
- `/plan` and `/goal` are client modes and are not automatically controlled by Harness.
- Authoring-only prompts help this repository improve the Harness itself and should not be shipped into user projects by default.
- Package-facing behavior changes must keep both `README.md` and `packages/sdlc-harness/README.md` aligned with the full public capability list, not only `PROJECT_SPEC.md` or release notes.
- Local Skill overrides are append-only in v1. They let projects add role preferences or complete local Skill extensions without replacing lifecycle, task, gate or allowed-path rules from the package Skill.
- `sync` auto-detects a complete Skill override when the override file starts with `name` and `description` frontmatter, validates that `name` matches the target skill, merges the override `description` into the final top-level metadata and appends the stripped body.
- `sync` writes a semantic maintenance note into each generated `Local Override` block so future agents can review phase boundaries, `allowed_paths`, `required_gates`, commit/release rules and completion checks for conflicts.
- `sync` blocks unknown files under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/*.md`, so a misspelled Skill name cannot silently fail to apply.
- `pjsdlc_managed/override_skills` keeps override configuration with other managed workflow configuration while preserving `<harnessRoot>/skills/**` as the shallow hard file index.
- When a user explicitly asks to slice an existing complete PRD/product document or complete tech plan into multiple slices, `pjsdlc_pm_prd` and `pjsdlc_architect_design` now require validating replacement slice coverage, updating `.docs/INDEX.md` and generated `overview.md`, synchronizing `plan.draft.yaml` references for tech plan slicing, and then deleting the superseded complete file so the facts are not duplicated.
- `pjsdlc_pm_prd`, `pjsdlc_architect_design`, `pjsdlc_reviewer`, `pjsdlc_tester`, `pjsdlc_release_manager` and `pjsdlc_rfc_recalibrate` create or resume one small `TASK-*` task before writing phase outputs. `pjsdlc_manager` routes `/prd`, `/design`, `/review`, `/test`, `/release` and `/rfc` through those task protocols and treats remaining open tasks as phase-exit blockers.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Earlier wording treated all workflow role files as native Skills. The current model distinguishes native hard-index hydration from Harness soft-index routing.
- The default authoring root moved from `.agent` to `.codex` after target-agent selection was added.
- DEV-043 consolidated legacy task records for role prompts, skill layout and natural-language control into this module-level doc.

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- When adding a workflow role, update both the Skill file and the soft-index contract in lifecycle/phase policies.
- If a client-specific native skill root is supported, document it as hard-index behavior without assuming every Agent hydrates it identically.
- Do not document direct edits to `<harnessRoot>/skills/**/SKILL.md` as a customization path; use `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/*.md` and `sdlc-harness sync`.
