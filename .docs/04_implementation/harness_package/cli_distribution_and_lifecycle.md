## 2. 当前实现范围

- `agent-project-sdlc` npm package exposes the `sdlc-harness` CLI binary.
- `init` / `init --adopt` create or adopt a project Harness without overwriting user-owned project code.
- Fresh `init` lifecycle routes new projects to `SPRINTING` with `active_role: "developer"` and `active_skill: "pjsdlc_dev_sprint"`; generated plan files do not duplicate `current_phase`.
- `sync` materializes managed Harness assets from package canonical assets into the selected `<harnessRoot>`.
- `upgrade` refreshes `<harnessRoot>/config.yaml` package identity and schema metadata, runs schema migrations and then syncs managed assets.
- `doctor` reports Harness config, managed file drift, override state and suggested gates. The displayed package version is read from the installed npm package metadata, not from project config.
- `validate-*` commands expose package-side validation entry points for Harness state and phase artifacts.
- 当前 authoring workspace 使用 `.codex` as `harnessFolderName`; `Other` agent selection still falls back to `.agent`.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
User runs sdlc-harness init/init --adopt
-> choose target Agent unless explicit harness folder/config exists
-> resolve <harnessRoot>
-> write config/state/docs scaffold
-> sync package canonical assets
-> doctor reports readiness
```

```txt
Existing project runs sdlc-harness upgrade
-> read current package/config/schema
-> run migrations for root names, managed layout, markers, plan/lifecycle shape
-> sync canonical assets
-> doctor reports remaining drift or blockers
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- Agent selection happens before folder selection. `Codex` is the default and writes `.codex`; `Other` asks for a custom folder and defaults to `.agent`.
- New project lifecycle scaffolding starts at `SPRINTING` and allows `REVIEWING` next. Generated `plan.yaml` stores `current_task_id`, `next_task_sequence` and `tasks`; generated `plan.draft.yaml` stores only draft sequencing and tasks.
- Explicit CLI flags and existing JSON config have higher priority than interactive defaults.
- Managed files use package metadata blocks and merge strategies instead of blind overwrites.
- Package name and CLI name are intentionally separate: npm installs `agent-project-sdlc`, users run `sdlc-harness`.
- Migrations preserve compatibility with earlier `.harness`, `.agents` and `.agent` layouts while converging new installs on the configured `<harnessRoot>`.
- `migrateConfig` rewrites `core.package`, deletes legacy `core.version`, and preserves `core.schema_version`. Package version is intentionally not persisted in project config because the installed package manifest is the source of truth.
- Plan migrations remove stale `current_phase` from active and draft plans, remove draft `current_task_id`, and strip duplicate `phase` / `linked_task_id` from `parallel_execution`.
- Validation commands mirror the Python Harness gates closely enough for package consumers to run health checks without depending on this authoring workspace.
- `validate-dev` checks `Development Self-Test Report` content against the current `self_test_contract`: it requires legal `Report Status`, Module Application Entry, Module Key Test Path, scenario results, executed gates, Observable Exit, Current Blocker, Testing Handoff Readiness and Evidence Index Refs; only accepts completion when report status and every scenario are `PASS`; rejects template module-key-path text, ambiguous status rows, missing scenario row evidence, missing required gates, embedded debug/operator/runbook/exploration log sections, `Actual Evidence` body fields, overlong reports, high-risk reports without `.docs/09_runbooks/**` evidence refs or Current Operator Path hard constraints, high-risk implementation docs with mainline evidence dump/operator log/failed-attempt sections, unpromoted session / QR / canonical path / do-not-retry judgments, and browser reports without page URL plus browser/Playwright/screenshot evidence. It remains a content consistency gate, not a command execution audit.
- Managed `phase_contracts.yaml` now distributes a lightweight explicit phase graph: `phases` hold node contracts, top-level `transitions` hold legal directed edges and minimal effects. Package `validate-harness` rejects graph drift such as missing `transitions`, legacy `next` / `returns`, unknown targets or invalid `<suspended_phase>` usage; synced `transition.py` consumes the graph while retaining legacy fallback for older consumer policies.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `sdlc-harness` CLI commands (`init`, `sync`, `upgrade`, `doctor`, `validate-*`) and the root `npm run sdlc-harness` adapter.
- Exit / side effects: writes or checks Harness state/assets, reports validator diagnostics, and never publishes or pushes by default.
- Config contract: `package.json#sdlcHarness.harnessFolderName`, `<harnessRoot>/config.yaml` (`core.package`, `core.schema_version`, managed files and local overrides), and package default config.
- Fixture/live boundary: package tests and consumer lab use local fixtures; npm registry publish/smoke remains release-stage live behavior.

## Development Evidence

- Runnable Entry: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc`, `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source`, `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source`, `make validate-dev`, and `make validate-harness` are the task verification entrypoints.
- Observable Exit: `tests/sdlc-harness/sync-init-doctor.test.mjs` asserts generated config omits `core.version` and `doctor` reports `core package: agent-project-sdlc@<installed package version>`; `tests/sdlc-harness/upgrade.test.mjs` asserts migrated config omits legacy `core.version`; `package check-source` output was `package source OK`.
- Basic Self-test Evidence: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` PASS with 10/10 tests; `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source` PASS; `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` PASS.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Earlier plans used `.harness`, `.agents` and then `.agent` as defaults; current behavior is target-agent first, with Codex mapping to `.codex`.
- Historical task docs were written under `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/dev_*.md`; DEV-043 migrated those facts into this module-level doc and sibling module docs.
- TASK-058 is a bug fix to existing `upgrade` metadata persistence; it does not add a public CLI capability, so `README.md`, `packages/sdlc-harness/README.md`, `PROJECT_SPEC.md` and `tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs` did not require updates. Regression coverage lives in `tests/sdlc-harness/upgrade.test.mjs`.

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Future package lifecycle changes should update this document instead of creating task-grain `dev_*.md` implementation docs.
- When CLI behavior changes, keep README user guidance, PRD acceptance criteria and package tests in sync.
- `tools/consumer_lab_full_test.mjs` keeps its fixture implementation doc aligned with the current `Development Self-Test Report` contract, including `Report Status`, while focused validator regressions live in `tests/sdlc-harness/validators.test.mjs`.
