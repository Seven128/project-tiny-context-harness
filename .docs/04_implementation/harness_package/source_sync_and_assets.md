## 2. 当前实现范围

- The authoring workspace is the source of truth for `AGENTS.md`, root `README.md`, workflow Skills, templates, policies, Makefile include assets, user-side Python tools and GitHub workflow assets.
- `package sync-source` copies or extracts those source files into `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/**`.
- `package check-source` verifies that package assets have not drifted from authoring sources.
- User-project `sync` materializes package assets into the configured `<harnessRoot>` and project root using managed strategies, including project-root `tools/*.py` workflow helpers.
- Authoring-only Skills under `<harnessRoot>/skills/authoring/**` are excluded from package assets.
- User-owned Markdown files may contain fixed package-managed sections. `sync` / `upgrade` update only `memory.md#Harness Guidance` and `.docs/INDEX.md#Harness Maintenance Rules`, while preserving user memory entries, artifact maps and links outside those sections.
- The default GitHub workflow is safely upgradable only when the file has `pjsdlc:sdlc-harness:github-workflow:*` markers or still exactly matches the old generated workflow without markers; customized no-marker workflows are skipped and reported as `customized`.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Author edits Harness source files
-> sdlc-harness package sync-source
-> package assets are regenerated
-> sdlc-harness package check-source verifies no drift
-> npm package ships assets
-> user project runs sdlc-harness sync/upgrade
-> managed assets materialize into <harnessRoot>, root files and tools/*.py
-> package-managed sections in user-owned Markdown files are merged by heading
-> marker-managed or exact-old GitHub workflow is updated; customized workflow is skipped
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- `AGENTS.md` is synced as an extracted managed block, so project-specific text outside the block remains user-owned.
- Root `README.md` is copied into `assets/docs/README.md` so installed packages expose the full user guide to agents without overwriting a consumer repository README.
- Skills are distributed under `<harnessRoot>/skills`, policies/templates live under `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed`, and user-side Python workflow helpers are distributed under project-root `tools/`.
- The package keeps a hard source mapping manifest, not a runtime scan of arbitrary repository paths.
- `copy-tree` supports exclude patterns so authoring-only material stays local to this repository.
- The tools source mapping copies `tools/*.py` into `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/tools/**` and excludes authoring-only `consumer_lab_full_test.mjs` / `release_npm.mjs`; `sync` copies those assets into user projects.
- Makefile integration is an include block, allowing project-specific targets to win on name conflicts.
- The current package does not guarantee native skill hydration for every Agent. It distributes files in the chosen root and exposes Harness soft routing through `AGENTS.md`.
- `memory.md#Harness Guidance` and `.docs/INDEX.md#Harness Maintenance Rules` use Markdown headings as the package-owned merge boundary. The merge replaces the managed section when present, appends it when missing, and removes known legacy untitled memory guidance / exact legacy index maintenance text to avoid duplicates.
- `sync` runs user-owned guidance section sync regardless of `managed_files` so older configs receive the sections after package updates. `upgrade` also runs the same merge during migrations before its normal sync pass.
- Config migration now backfills the `.github/workflows/harness.yml` managed file entry for older projects, so the safe workflow migration path is reachable after upgrade.
- Config migration now also backfills `tools` as a managed file entry for older projects, so `upgrade` can refresh stale user-side workflow helpers such as `tools/transition.py`.
- The sync CLI and upgrade report print customized workflow skips without treating them as blockers.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `sdlc-harness package sync-source`, `sdlc-harness package check-source`, user-project `sdlc-harness init`, `sdlc-harness sync`, and `sdlc-harness upgrade`.
- Exit / side effects: source sync rewrites package assets from authoring sources; check-source reports drift without writing; init/sync/upgrade merge package-managed guidance sections into `memory.md` and `.docs/INDEX.md`, materialize `tools/*.py`, and write marker-managed or exact-old generated workflow files while skipping customized no-marker workflows.
- Config contract: `packages/sdlc-harness/source-mappings.yaml`, `<harnessRoot>/config.yaml`, and managed-file metadata markers.
- Fixture/live boundary: package-source tests use temporary fixtures; real package asset updates happen only in the authoring workspace.

## Development Evidence

- Evidence Level: `local_runtime`.
- Target Runtime Environment: `local`; no external services, credentials or deployed runtime are required.
- Runnable Entry: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc`, `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source`, `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source`, `make validate-harness`, `make validate-rfc` and `make validate-dev` from the repository root.
- Observable Exit: package tests passed; package source check returned `package source OK`; `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/tools/transition.py` consumes `phase_contracts.yaml#transitions`; init/sync/upgrade tests prove `tools/*.py` are materialized and stale copies are replaced.
- Client / Server Initialization: not applicable for servers; local CLI initialization is `npm install` workspace dependencies plus `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` build.
- Config Contract: default `<harnessRoot>/config.yaml` includes `path: "tools"` with `strategy: "managed"`; upgrade migration backfills the same managed file entry.
- Testing Handoff Readiness: Review/Testing can inspect `tools/transition.py`, `packages/sdlc-harness/assets/tools/**`, `tests/sdlc-harness/transition.test.mjs`, package source tests and consumer lab script output.
- Known Missing Runtime Boundaries: none for this local CLI/package workflow; deployed runtime is out of scope.
- Basic Self-test Evidence: Development Self-Test Report below records the executed gates and scenario results for `TASK-082`.

## Development Self-Test Report

- Contract Source: `.docs/rfc/RFC_025_later_stage_rfc_routing_and_tools_distribution.md#8-development-self-test-impact`
- Scenario Results: `transition-rfc-interrupt` PASS; `package-tools-materialization` PASS.
- Executed Gates: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc` PASS; `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package sync-source` PASS; `node packages/sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js package check-source` PASS; `make validate-harness` PASS; `make validate-rfc` PASS; `make validate-dev` PASS.
- Module Key Test Path: `npm test --workspace agent-project-sdlc; python3 tools/transition.py fixture calls in tests/sdlc-harness/transition.test.mjs` starts by building package `dist`, runs node:test package-source/init/sync/upgrade/transition fixtures, verifies `transition-rfc-interrupt` through direct `tools/transition.py` fixture calls for `SPRINTING` / `REVIEWING` / `TESTING` / `RELEASING -> RFC_RECALIBRATION`, illegal pre-development RFC entry, normal `REVIEWING -> TESTING`, and `RFC_RECALIBRATION -> SPRINTING`; the same run verifies `package-tools-materialization` through source mapping, init/sync, stale tool replacement and upgrade backfill assertions.
- Evidence Index Refs: package regression, package source check and Harness gate outputs are recorded in git/test command history for `TASK-082`.
- Missing / Blockers: none.
- Testing Handoff Readiness: PASS; Review/Testing can rerun the commands above without external services.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Legacy package layouts referenced `.harness/managed`, `.agents/skills` and `.agent/managed`; current generated assets use `<harnessRoot>/skills` and `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed`.
- DEV-043 removed the legacy implementation-doc directory as an active asset/documentation target; source sync does not treat `.docs/04_implementation/npm_package/**` as a maintained path.

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Any change to `.codex/skills/**`, `.codex/pjsdlc_managed/**`, `AGENTS.md`, root `README.md`, Makefile include, `tools/*.py` or CI asset source should be followed by `package sync-source` and `package check-source`.
- If an operation becomes repetitive and deterministic, prefer extracting it into a script and documenting the script here instead of keeping it as manual release/development lore.
