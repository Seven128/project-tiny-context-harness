## 2. 当前实现范围

- `.work_products/INDEX.md` is the durable workflow work product routing table.
- `.work_products/**` is the canonical tracked root for durable stage outputs, including Markdown fact slices, UI/UX design materials, screenshots, mock artifacts, evidence indexes and runbooks.
- `.artifacts/**` remains the ignored temporary/generated artifact root and is not a long-term fact source.
- `.work_products/<stage>/overview.md` files are generated artifacts and are not hand edited.
- `make work-products-overview` regenerates all stage overviews from Markdown slices.
- `make validate-work-products-overviews` and `make validate-harness` check that generated overviews are current.
- `sdlc-harness upgrade` migrates legacy `.docs/**` projects to `.work_products/**` and rewrites old task fields (`docs`, `result_docs`, `implementation_doc`) to `work_products`, `result_work_products` and `implementation_work_product`.
- UI/UX design materials can be stored under `.work_products/02_experience/assets/<capability>/...`; `validate-uiux` checks that UX slice references to those asset paths exist.
- `make validate-design` excludes generated `overview.md` and `README.md` from design deliverables, validates `plan.draft.yaml` task shape, requires development draft tasks to link existing tech plan slices through `work_products.tech_plan`, rejects one shared primary tech plan for multiple development drafts, and requires dedicated architecture slices for explicit cross-cutting themes.
- `tools/validate_task_docs.py` requires every implementation doc slice to be linked from `.work_products/INDEX.md`.
- Root README is a user guide; `PROJECT_SPEC.md` carries the lightweight project map, stable canonical behavior and ADR index.
- Durable design rationale is split into `.work_products/05_decisions/ADR_*.md`; `.codex/state/memory.md#Harness Design Decisions` links Agents to those ADRs without copying their body.

## Runnable Entry/Exit

- Entry points: `make work-products-overview`, `make validate-work-products-overviews`, `make validate-harness`, `tools/validate_task_docs.py`, and package-side validators.
- Exit / side effects: overview generation writes `.work_products/**/overview.md`; validation commands report stale overview, missing links or gate errors.
- Config contract: `.work_products/INDEX.md`, `.work_products/**` slice layout and Harness Make targets.
- Fixture/live boundary: local repository documentation validation only; no runtime service or external system is involved.

## 4. 核心数据流

```txt
Legacy project upgrade
-> .docs exists and .work_products does not
-> rename .docs to .work_products
-> rewrite state, plan, draft plan, memory and work product refs
-> sync managed assets and guidance sections
```

```txt
Markdown slice changes
-> update .work_products/INDEX.md if routing changed
-> make work-products-overview
-> generated overview.md files include source hash and slice content
-> make validate-work-products-overviews / make validate-harness confirms freshness
```

```txt
ARCHITECTING exit or design regression check
-> tools/validate_design.py / package validate-design scan non-generated architecture and tech plan slices
-> plan.draft.yaml development tasks must reference existing work_products.tech_plan slices
-> multiple draft tasks must have distinct primary tech plan slices
-> explicit cross-cutting themes require dedicated architecture slices
```

```txt
Implementation doc slice exists
-> tools/validate_task_docs.py scans .work_products/04_implementation/**/*.md
-> each slice must be linked from .work_products/INDEX.md
-> each slice must state Runnable Entry/Exit facts or explicit Not applicable
-> missing links fail validate-dev / relevant gates
```

## 5. 关键实现逻辑

- Overview files are deterministic and include every non-overview Markdown slice under their stage directory.
- Generated overviews are for browsing and handoff; Markdown slices and `.work_products/INDEX.md` remain the source of truth.
- `.work_products/**` is broader than Markdown: non-Markdown durable materials are tracked work products, while overviews still only aggregate Markdown slices.
- Upgrade blocks if `.docs/**` and `.work_products/**` both contain user content, because automatic merging would risk losing or duplicating canonical facts.
- Durable "why" content belongs in ADR slices, while `PROJECT_SPEC.md` keeps short summaries and back-links.
- Design validation now treats generated `overview.md` and `README.md` as non-deliverables, so visual rollups cannot satisfy architecture or tech plan slice requirements.
- `plan.draft.yaml` is part of the design gate because task granularity must line up with tech plan fact granularity before SPRINTING starts.
- Cross-cutting architecture validation uses conservative trigger phrases from PRD, tech plan and draft task text, then requires different architecture docs for different triggered categories.
- Implementation docs are validated as module/subsystem/core-flow slices, not task ledgers, and must include runnable entry/exit facts so TESTING receives stable boundaries.
- DEV-043 removes the legacy `npm_package/dev_*.md` docs from the active docs graph and replaces them with module-level slices.

## 6. 与技术方案的偏移

- Early documentation used task-grain implementation work_products. The current model uses module-level implementation docs and treats git history as the task action record.
- `README.md` was split from the full product specification so npm package users see a lightweight guide first.
- Historical workflow outputs were named `.docs/**`; current canonical behavior uses `.work_products/**` and only accepts legacy `.docs/**` through upgrade migration.

## 9. 后续维护注意事项

- Never edit `overview.md` directly; regenerate it.
- When a work product slice is moved or renamed, update `.work_products/INDEX.md` in the same task.
