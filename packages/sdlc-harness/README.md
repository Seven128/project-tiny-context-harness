# AI SDLC Harness

`agent-project-sdlc` provides the `sdlc-harness` CLI and canonical workflow assets for AI-assisted software delivery. It materializes an agent-readable lifecycle, workflow skills, templates, policies, gates and documentation structure into a project workspace.

## Install

```sh
npm install -D agent-project-sdlc
npx sdlc-harness init
```

For existing projects:

```sh
npx sdlc-harness init --adopt
```

## Capabilities

| Capability | Entry Point | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Project initialization | `npx sdlc-harness init` | Creates `AGENTS.md`, `<harnessRoot>/state/**`, workflow skills, managed templates/policies, `.docs/**` and a Makefile include. |
| Existing project adoption | `npx sdlc-harness init --adopt` | Adds Harness non-destructively to an existing repository. |
| Configurable Harness root | `--harness-folder`, `package.json#sdlcHarness.harnessFolderName`, `sdlc-harness.config.json` | Supports Codex `.codex`, Claude `.claude`, Cursor `.cursor`, Cline `.cline`, Roo `.roo`, Gemini `.gemini` or a custom folder. |
| Managed file sync | `npx sdlc-harness sync` | Materializes package canonical assets into the configured Harness root while preserving project state, docs and local overrides. |
| Upgrade | `npx sdlc-harness upgrade` | Runs migrations and sync for already-adopted projects. |
| Diagnostics | `npx sdlc-harness doctor` | Reports Harness root, package version, schema version and key managed paths. |
| Validators | `npx sdlc-harness validate-*`, `make validate-current`, `make validate-harness` | Checks product, design slicing, development, review, test, release, RFC, active plan shape, prompt language contract and generated overview freshness. |
| Lifecycle workflow | `<harnessRoot>/state/lifecycle.yaml`, `<harnessRoot>/state/plan.yaml`, `.docs/**` | Tracks REQUIREMENT_GATHERING, ARCHITECTING, SPRINTING, REVIEWING, TESTING, RELEASING and RFC_RECALIBRATION facts. |
| Stage task control | `plan.yaml`, `make validate-plan`, `npx sdlc-harness validate-plan` | Keeps each stage's agent work in small `TASK-*` tasks with `phase` metadata and scoped paths/gates. |
| Natural-language control | `AGENTS.md` plus workflow skills | Lets users say things like "continue", "start development", "run tests" or "requirements changed"; agents map these to workflow actions. |
| Optional parallel execution contract | `plan.yaml#parallel_execution` | Enabled only when users explicitly request multi-agent, parallel or multi-worktree execution; supports runtime-managed subagents or user-orchestrated worker prompts. |
| Workflow skills | `<harnessRoot>/skills/pjsdlc_*/SKILL.md` | Provides role prompts for product, architecture, development, implementation docs, review, testing, release and RFC recalibration. |
| Project-local skill overrides | `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/<skill_name>.md` + `npx sdlc-harness sync` | Appends project-specific role instructions to generated Skill output without editing managed Skill files. |
| Local policy overrides | `<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/policies/*.local.yaml` | Preserves project-specific policy additions separately from package defaults. |
| Agent-readable user guide asset | `assets/docs/README.md` | Ships the source workspace root README inside the npm package so user agents can inspect the full workflow guide from `node_modules`. |
| Documentation overview | `make docs-overview`, `make validate-doc-overviews` | Regenerates human-readable stage overviews from `.docs/**` fact slices. |
| Package source checks | `sdlc-harness package sync-source`, `sdlc-harness package check-source` | Maintainer commands for keeping package canonical assets aligned with this source workspace. |

## Skill Overrides

Do not edit generated files under `<harnessRoot>/skills/**/SKILL.md`; `sync` and `upgrade` regenerate them.

To customize a stage role prompt, create:

```txt
<harnessRoot>/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/<skill_name>.md
```

Example:

```txt
.codex/pjsdlc_managed/override_skills/pjsdlc_dev_sprint.md
```

Then run:

```sh
npx sdlc-harness sync
```

The sync output is the package base Skill plus one appended `Local Override` block. Override files support either a plain project-local snippet or a complete `SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter. Complete Skill overrides are appended, not replaced: `sync` validates the override `name`, merges the override `description` into the generated top-level metadata, strips the override frontmatter, and appends the full body. After sync, users or their agents should review the merged Skill for semantic conflicts in phase boundaries, `allowed_paths`, `required_gates`, commit/release rules and completion checks. Unknown skill names block sync so misspellings do not silently fail.

## Optional Parallel Execution

The default workflow is serial. Agents should only create `parallel_execution` in `plan.yaml` when the user explicitly asks for multi-agent, parallel or multi-worktree execution.

- `runtime_managed`: use only when the current agent runtime can spawn subagents. The main agent assigns workers, waits for results, reviews, merges or cherry-picks, and runs the total gate.
- `user_orchestrated`: use when the runtime cannot spawn subagents. The main agent generates copyable worker prompts, and the user manually opens Codex conversations or worktrees and pastes them.

`parallel_execution` does not store duplicate current phase or current task fields. Agents read phase from `<harnessRoot>/state/lifecycle.yaml#current_phase` and task selection from `<harnessRoot>/state/plan.yaml#current_task_id`.

The CLI does not promise to automatically launch Codex agents. Workers do not need to communicate with each other; the main agent owns final fact-source updates such as PRD, plan, implementation docs, test results and generated overviews.

## Stage Task Control

Every stage's agent work is plan-controlled. Conversational PRD or design creation, existing document slicing, fact-source-based synthesis, development, review, testing, release preparation and RFC recalibration should create or resume one small `TASK-*` task in `plan.yaml` with a valid `phase`, write the current task's `result_docs` or `implementation_doc`, update indexes/overviews, run `validate-plan`, and remove the task after completion. Phase exit validators reject remaining open tasks.

The generic rule is that any workflow promoting a draft task into a formal `TASK-*` in `plan.yaml` must remove the source draft from its draft queue in the same state update. The formal task is then recovered only from `plan.yaml`; completed history lives in implementation docs, git, PR and CI records. The built-in Harness draft queue is currently `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]`, which means unadopted development drafts only. `/devloop` treats the development queue as exhausted only when both `plan.yaml.tasks[]` and `plan.draft.yaml.tasks[]` have no executable task.

Before development starts, `ARCHITECTING` can return to `REQUIREMENT_GATHERING` for PRD edits. The manager uses `python3 tools/transition.py --to REQUIREMENT_GATHERING`, the PM workflow updates the PRD through one `TASK-*`, then `validate-pm` and `python3 tools/transition.py --to ARCHITECTING` return the project to design. Requirement changes after `SPRINTING` still use RFC recalibration.

`validate-design` treats semantic slicing as a hard gate. Generated `overview.md` files do not count as deliverables, development draft tasks in `plan.draft.yaml` must reference existing tech plan slices through `docs.tech_plan`, multiple development draft tasks need distinct primary tech plan slices, and explicit AI provider/copilot, external-system, or compliance/permission/audit themes require dedicated architecture slices.

SPRINTING Definition of Done includes runnable entry/exit boundaries. API, CLI, server route, adapter, worker, provider, config-contract and fixture/live boundaries promised by a technical plan or task must be implemented or marked `BLOCKED` during development. REVIEWING treats missing entry/exit as blocking, and TESTING only exercises existing entrypoints; it must not add product runtime, bootstrap, provider adapter, deploy code or package runtime scripts.

`validate-test` keeps its command name as the TESTING phase gate. The canonical TESTING deliverable is `.docs/07_test/TEST_REPORT.md`, which records test matrix, regression evidence, runnable entry/exit coverage, coverage gaps and final decision. Legacy `.docs/07_test/TEST_PLAN.md` remains accepted for existing projects, but new test evidence should use `TEST_REPORT.md`.

## ADR And Memory Boundaries

`.docs/05_decisions/` stores ADRs, or Architecture Decision Records. ADRs answer why a key architecture choice was made instead of another option. Architecture and tech plan slices may include local design rationale; create an ADR when a decision has real alternatives, affects multiple modules or stages, is likely to be challenged later, or would be expensive to reverse.

`<harnessRoot>/state/memory.md` is only a short cross-stage reminder and navigation surface. It answers what an agent should remember next time and where to find the source. Memory may link to ADRs, PRDs, tech plans or implementation docs; full context, alternatives, tradeoffs and long-term consequences belong in `.docs/05_decisions/` ADRs or other formal `.docs/**` fact sources.
